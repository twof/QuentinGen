1
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:41,720
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:51,790
Well, I bet I could fry an egg on your head right now...

3
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,880
if I wanted to.

4
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:00,720
You know kiddo,

5
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,130
I'd like to believe that you're aware enough even now...

6
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:10,240
to know that there is nothing sadistic in my actions.

7
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:18,025
Maybe towards those other jokers,

8
00:01:20,144 --> 00:01:21,570
but not you.

9
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:27,814
You know kiddo, this moment,

10
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:36,669
this is me at my most non-sadistic.

11
00:01:36,832 --> 00:01:40,875
Bill, it's your baby.

12
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:55,960
¢Ü I was five and he was six. ¢Ü

13
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:59,800
¢Ü We rode on horses made of sticks. ¢Ü

14
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,240
¢Ü He wore black and I wore white. ¢Ü

15
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,160
¢Ü He would always win the fight. ¢Ü

16
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:07,680
¢Ü Bang, Bang. He shot me down. ¢Ü

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,120
¢Ü Bang, Bang. I hit the ground. ¢Ü

18
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,960
¢Ü Bang, Bang. That aweful sound. ¢Ü

19
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,280
¢Ü Bang, Bang. My baby shot me down. ¢Ü

20
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,120
¢Ü Seasons came and changed the time. ¢Ü

21
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,960
¢Ü When I grew up I called him mine ¢Ü

22
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,360
¢Ü He would always laugh and say, ¢Ü

23
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,440
¢Ü Remember when we used to play. ¢Ü

24
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:46,080
¢Ü Bang, Bang. I shot you down. ¢Ü

25
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,960
¢Ü Bang, Bang. You hit the ground. ¢Ü

26
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,800
¢Ü Bang, Bang. That aweful sound. ¢Ü

27
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:56,920
¢Ü Bang, Bang. I used to shoot you down. ¢Ü

28
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,160
¢Ü Music played and people sang. ¢Ü

29
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,640
¢Ü Just for me the church bells rang. ¢Ü

30
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,000
¢Ü Now he's gone, I don't know why. ¢Ü

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,520
¢Ü And till this day, sometimes I cry. ¢Ü

32
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,360
¢Ü He didn't even say good-bye, ¢Ü

33
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,160
¢Ü didn't take the time to lie. ¢Ü

34
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,800
¢Ü Bang, Bang. He shot me down. ¢Ü

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,480
¢Ü Bang, Bang. I hit the ground. ¢Ü

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,320
¢Ü Bang, Bang. That aweful sound. ¢Ü

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,120
¢Ü Bang, Bang. My baby shot me down. ¢Ü

38
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,360
Coming.

39
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,200
-Carol, I cannot believe you are early!

40
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,280
Come on bitch.

41
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,080
Come on.

42
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,080
Mommy, I'm home.

43
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,920
Hey baby. How was school?

44
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:01,240
Mommy, what happened to you and TV room?

45
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,600
Oh, that little dog of yours,

46
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,760
got his ass into the living room and acted like a damn pool.

47
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,280
That's what happened baby.

48
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,040
Barney did this?

49
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,160
Baby, you can't come in here.

50
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,280
There's broken glass everywhere.

51
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,120
You could cut yourself.

52
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,320
This is an old friend of mommy's I haven't seen in a long time.

53
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,800
Hi honey. I'm ??(bleep). What's your name?

54
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,720
Her name is Nikki.

55
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,520
Nikki, such a pretty name for such a pretty girl.

56
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:46,280
How old are you Nikki?

57
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:50,280
Nikki, ??(bleep) asked you a question.

58
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,280
I'm four.

59
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
Four years old, eh.

60
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,760
You know, I had a little girl once.

61
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:04,600
She'd be about four now.

62
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:11,120
Now baby, me and mommy's friend have grown up stuff to talk about.

63
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,600
I want you to go in your room now and leave us alone
till I tell you to come out. OK?

64
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,080
Nikkia. In your room, now.

65
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,960
You want some coffee?

66
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,800
Yeah, sure.

67
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,600
This Pasadena's homemaker's name is Jeanny Bell.

68
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,280
Her husband is doctor Lawrence Bell.

69
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,880
But back when we were acquainted four years ago,

70
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,080
her name was Vernita Green.

71
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,680
Her code name was Copperhead.

72
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,680
Mine, black Mamba.

73
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,200
Can I have a towel?

74
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,040
Yeah.

75
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,480
Thanks.

76
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,400
Still take cream and sugar, right?

77
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,240
Yeah.

78
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,960
I suppose it's a little late for an apology, huh?

79
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,480
You suppose correctly.

80
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,000
Look bitch,

81
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,080
I need to know if you're going to
start any shit around my baby girl.

82
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:28,360
You can relax for now.

83
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,200
I'm not going to murder you in front of your child, OK?

84
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,600
You need to be more rational because I don't know what you're capable of.

85
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:42,360
It's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I lack. Not rationality.

86
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,360
I know I fucked you over. I fucked you over bad.

87
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,600
I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.

88
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,440
You have every right to get even.

89
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,840
No. Get even? Even Steven?

90
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,720
I would have to kill you.

91
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:11,000
Go to Nikkie's room, kill her.

92
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Then wait for your husband the good doctor Bell to come home and kill him.

93
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,120
That would be even Steven.

94
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,240
That would leave us square.

95
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,080
Look, if I could go back in a machine I would, but I can't.

96
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:27,960
All I can tell you is that I'm a different person now.

97
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,760
Oh, great. I don't care.

98
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:36,600
Be that as it may, I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness.

99
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,240
However, I beseech you for both what happened and for my daughter.

100
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,080
Bitch. You can stop right there.

101
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,800
Just because I have no wish to murder you
before the eyes of your daughter...

102
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,640
does not mean that parading her around
in front of me is going to inspire sympathy.

103
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,280
You and I have unfinished business.

104
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:04,960
And not a God damned fucking thing you've done in the subsequent 4 years,
including getting knocked up, is going to change that.

105
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,320
When do we do this?

106
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,160
It all depends. When do you want to die?

107
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:16,000
Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,160
How about tonight, bitch?

109
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,560
Splendid. Where?

110
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,400
There a baseball diamond where I coach a little league about a mile from here.

111
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,960
We meet there around 2:30 in the morning,

112
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:29,840
dressed all in black, your hair in black stocking,

113
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:33,680
we'll have a knife fight. You won't be bothered.

114
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,000
And now, I have to fix Nikki cereal.

115
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,080
Bill always said you were one of the best ladies
he ever saw with an edge weapon.

116
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
Fuck you bitch.

117
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,600
I know you did qualify that shit.

118
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,120
So you, you can kiss my mother fucking ass just like mamba.

119
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,720
Mamba. I should have been more like mother fucking mamba.

120
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,720
It's a weapon of your choice and you can stick with
your butcher knife if you want, that's fine with me.

121
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:14,080
Very funny bitch. Very funny.

122
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,240
It's not my intention to do this in front of you.

123
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:17,840
For that I'm sorry.

124
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:21,680
You can take my word for it.

125
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,680
Your mother had it coming.

126
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:43,600
When you grow up, just don't feel wrong about it.

127
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,480
I'll be waiting.

128
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:48,440
Well, give me the gory details on that one.

129
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:52,280
It's a God damn massacre, pop.

130
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:56,120
They wiped out the whole wedding party, execution style.

131
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,280
Give me a figure.

132
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,400
Nine dead bodies.

133
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,800
We're talking the whole chebang.

134
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:09,560
Bride, groom, reverend...reverend's wife.

135
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,640
Hell, they even shot that old colored fellow that played the organ.

136
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,040
Appears to me somebody objected to the union that wasn't able to hold their piece.

137
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,280
Good great green!

138
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:34,920
What'd I tell you, pop!

139
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,880
Like a God damn Nicaraguan death squad.

140
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,720
This is a shit can mess of war in the house of the lord.

141
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:45,360
Sorry pop.

142
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,960
Incidentally, was a weird profession.

143
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,800
My guesstimate it's a lumber hit squad.

144
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,640
Four, maybe five strong.

145
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,760
How can you tell?

146
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:01,600
Well it's sure a steady hand did this.

147
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,280
It ain't no squirrelly amateur.

148
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,640
This was the work of a salty dog.

149
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,400
You can tell by the cleanliness of the carving that killed crazy ram pig,

150
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:15,240
though it may be, though cut a fine line.

151
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,240
If he wasn't a moron, he'd almost get a merit.

152
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,280
Who's the bride?

153
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,840
Don't know.

154
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,680
The name on the marriage certificate is Arlene Macuvelli.

155
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,160
That's a fake.

156
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:44,320
We've always been calling her the bride on account of her dress.

157
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,200
You can tell if she's pregnant.

158
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,480
The man had to be a mad dog to kill
a damned good looking gal like that in the head.

159
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,080
Look at her.

160
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,920
A colored hair, big eyes.

161
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:06,920
She's a blood splattered angel.

162
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,360
-Son number one...
-Yeah.

163
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,680
Call Regan.

164
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:18,520
The cock sucker ain't dead.

165
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,720
I might never have liked you.

166
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,120
Quite in fact, I despise you.

167
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,440
But this shouldn't suggest I don't respect you.

168
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:06,360
Dying in our sleep is a luxury that are kinda rarely afforded.

169
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:10,720
My gift...to you.

170
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,880
For God's sake!

171
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,520
Hello Bill.

172
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:26,560
What's her condition?

173
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,240
Comatose.

174
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,960
Where is she?

175
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,120
I'm standing over her right now.

176
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,160
That's my girl.

177
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:40,960
Elle, you're going to abort the mission.

178
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,120
We owe her better than that.

179
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
No, you don't owe her shit.

180
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,760
Will you keep your voice down?

181
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,120
You don't owe her shit.

182
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,120
May I say one thing.

183
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,400
Speak.

184
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,120
You all beat the hell out of that woman, but you didn't kill her.

185
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:02,960
You put a bullet in her head but her heart just kept on beating.

186
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:09,080
Now you saw that yourself with your own beautiful blue eye. Did you not?

187
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:13,600
We've done a lot of things to this lady.

188
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
And if she wakes up, we'll do a whole lot more.

189
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,800
But one thing we won't do is sneak into her room in the night,

190
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,080
like a filthy rat and kill her in her sleep.

191
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:35,800
And the reason we won't do that thing is because that thing would lower us.

192
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:40,600
Don't you agree Miss Driver?

193
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,320
I guess.

194
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,400
Do you really have to guess?

195
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:49,240
No, I really don't have to guess. I know.

196
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:54,520
Come on home, honey.

197
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,680
Affirmative.

198
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,080
I love you very much.

199
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,920
I love you too.

200
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:08,440
Bye-Bye.

201
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,840
You thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?

202
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:25,320
A word of advise, shit head...

203
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,160
Don't you ever wake up.

204
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:07,680
At this moment, this is me, in my most sadistic moment.

205
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:12,760
Bill, it's your...

206
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:13,680
The price is 35 dollars a fuck, my friend.

207
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,600
Think you can get the freak on or what?

208
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,440
Oh yeah boy.

209
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,720
Ten, twenty, thirty...yeah.

210
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,160
Now here's the rules.

211
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:28,280
Rule number one, don't punch her.

212
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,720
The nurse comes in tomorrow and she's got a shiner or some less teeth, the jig's up.

213
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,120
No knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances.

214
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:37,480
And by the way, this little cunt's a spirit,
it's a motor reflex thing.

215
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:39,400
Spirit or no, no punching.

216
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,600
Now are we absolutely positively clear on rule number one?

217
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,560
Yeah.

218
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,840
Good. Rule number two.

219
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
No monkey bites or hickeys.

220
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,760
In fact, don't leave no marks of no kind.

221
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,400
After that, it's all good, buddy.

222
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,480
There's no one down at work till tomorrow,
so feel free to come back all you want.

223
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
Keep the noise down and try not to make a mess.

224
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,760
I'll be back in twenty.

225
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:07,640
Oh shit. By the way, not all the times, but sometimes
this chick's cooch can be as dry as a bucket of sand.

226
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:11,480
If she's dry, lube up with this and you'll be good to go.

227
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,200
Don't ask to keep it buddy.

228
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,040
Oh yeah.

229
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:31,160
God damn. You are the best looking girl I've had today.

230
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,560
Yo, stud, time's up buddy.

231
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,760
Coming in, ready or not.

232
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,600
Hey buddy, did you have yourself a good time?

233
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,760
Where's Bill?

234
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,600
Please stop hitting me.

235
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,720
I don't know who Bill is.

236
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:10,000
Bull shit.

237
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,000
She's a real slice of cutie pie they say, you know.

238
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,520
Jane Doe. They don't know shit about you.

239
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm from Huntsville Texas.

240
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,760
My name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.

241
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,840
Your name's Buck, right?

242
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,560
And you came here to fuck. Right?

243
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:44,360
You fucker.

244
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:53,240
Wiggle your big toe.

245
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:57,480
As I lay in the back of Buck's truck
trying to will my limbs out of entropy.

246
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:57,560
Wiggle your big toe.

247
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:03,320
I could see the faces of cunts who did this to me.

248
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:07,160
And the dick responsible.

249
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,240
Members all of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad.

250
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:19,000
When fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge,

251
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,840
it seems proof like no other that
not only does God exist,

252
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,760
you're doing his will.

253
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,360
At a time when I knew the least about my enemies,

254
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,280
the first name on my death list,

255
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:33,120
O-Ren Ishii was easiest to find.

256
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:41,560
But of course when one manages the difficult task of becoming queen
of the Tokyo underworld, one doesn't keep it a secret, does one?

257
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,000
O-Ren Ishii was born on an American military base in Tokyo, Japan.

258
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,640
The half Japanese, half Chinese American army brat
made her first acquaintance with death at the age of nine.

259
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:16,200
It was at that age that she witnessed the death of her parents
at the hands of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.

260
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:53,320
W-h-i-m-p-e-r.

261
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,720
Mommy!

262
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,960
She swore revenge.

263
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:37,800
Lucky for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.

264
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:45,120
At eleven, she got her revenge.

265
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,240
Look at me Matsumoto.

266
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:54,320
Look at my face.

267
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:56,520
Take a good look at my face.

268
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:00,360
Look at my eyes.

269
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,080
Look at my mouth.

270
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,640
Do I look familiar?

271
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,520
Do I look like somebody.

272
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,360
You murdered!

273
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:27,280
By twenty she was one of the top female assassins in the world.

274
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,600
At twenty-five she did her part
in the killing of nine innocent people,

275
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,360
including my unborn daughter,

276
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:25,200
in a small wedding chapel in El Paso, Texas.

277
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:29,320
But on that day, four years ago, she made one big mistake.

278
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,040
She should have killed ten.

279
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:39,880
However, before satisfaction be mine,

280
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:44,200
First thing first, wiggle your big toe.

281
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,200
Hard part's over.

282
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:58,040
Now, let's get these other piggies wiggling.

283
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,080
Welcome to Arrow. May I help you?

284
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:36,920
Okinawa...One way.

285
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,640
Hi.

286
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:11,600
Welcome.

287
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,400
You English?

288
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,920
Almost...American.

289
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,560
American. Welcome then.

290
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,880
Domo.

291
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,400
My English...very good.

292
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,560
You said domo, very good, can you speak Japanese?

293
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,400
No, oh no. Just a few words I learned since yesterday.

294
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:33,080
Um, may I sit at the bar?

295
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,920
Oh sure sure, please, sit.

296
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,440
What other words did you learn?

297
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,240
Oh, excuse me.

298
00:44:00,080 --> 00:44:03,920
Shut up, get your ass out here.

299
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,920
You'll excuse me.

300
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,720
Ahhh what other Japanese...do you know?

301
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,280
Oh, let's see. Arigato.

302
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,960
Arigato...mm

303
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:20,800
Um I already said domo, right?

304
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:23,400
Yeah. Oh yea yea yea.

305
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,760
Konijiwa.

306
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:28,120
Ah ah ah. Konichiwa.

307
00:44:28,120 --> 00:44:29,280
Ko-ni-chi-wa, please repeat.

308
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,720
Konichiwa.

309
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,480
Ah, that's good. Good, good.

310
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,360
You say Japanese words like Japanese.

311
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:38,280
-Now you're making fun of me.
-No no no.

312
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:42,120
See, serious business. Pronunciation very good.

313
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:47,320
You say arigato, like we say arigato.

314
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,160
Well thank you. I mean, arigato.

315
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,960
You should learn Japanese. Very easy.

316
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,720
No kidding. I heard it was kind of hard.

317
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,560
Most of the them, but you have a Japanese tongue.

318
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,520
OK OK omachikasama.

319
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,080
Oh my God,

320
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,520
I beg your pardon?

321
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,040
Drink.

322
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:45,920
Oh yes, um, a bottle of warm sake please.

323
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,880
Do you understand?

324
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,720
Do you understand me?

325
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,960
Sorry. Oh, first time in Japan?

326
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,600
Uh huh.

327
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,360
What brings you to Okinawa?

328
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,280
I came to see a man.

329
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:49,080
Oh yeah. You have a friend that you are in love?

330
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,760
Not quite.

331
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:53,120
A friend?

332
00:46:53,120 --> 00:46:54,480
I never met him.

333
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:59,280
Never? Who is he? May I ask?

334
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:04,560
Hattori Hanzo.

335
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,880
You must have big rats if you need Hattori Hanzo steel.

336
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,840
Huge.

337
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:09,880
May I?

338
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:13,720
You may.

339
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:16,120
Wait.

340
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,960
Try the second one from the top.

341
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:18,800
You like a samurai sword, I like baseball.

342
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:29,480
I wanted to show you these.

343
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:35,240
However, someone as you, who knows so much, must surely know.

344
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:40,520
I no longer make instruments of death.

345
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,080
What I have here.

346
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:48,880
I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.

347
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:54,440
Yet, proud as I am of my life's work.

348
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:02,520
I have retired.

349
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:11,920
Then give me one of these.

350
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:15,360
These are not for sale.

351
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:19,200
I didn't say sell me. I said give me.

352
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:24,880
Why...should I give you?

353
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:29,400
Because my vermin is a former student of yours.

354
00:51:32,110 --> 00:51:40,156
And considering the student,
I'd say you have a rather large obligation.

355
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:37,200
You can sleep here.

356
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,760
It was one year after the massacre in El Paso, Texas,

357
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,200
the Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically

358
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:55,040
in her Shakespearian-in-magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans

359
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:59,560
over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo.

360
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,040
When the final sword was sheathed,

361
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:05,880
it was O-ren iseii and her powerful posse,

362
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,840
the crazy 88, that proved the victor.

363
00:56:11,360 --> 00:56:13,760
The pretty lady to O-ren's right,

364
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:16,240
who's dressed like she's a villain on Startrek,

365
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:20,080
is O-ren's lawyer, best friend and second lieutenant,

366
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:23,920
the half-French-half-Japanese, Sofie Fatale.

367
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,080
Another former praetorship(?) of Bill's.

368
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:33,640
The young girl in the school uniform is O-ren's personal body guard,

369
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,080
17-year-old GoGo Yurari.

370
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:40,440
GoGo may be young, but what she lacks in age,

371
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,920
she makes up for in madness.

372
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:27,200
See what I mean?

373
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:31,040
The bold guy in a black suit and a Kato mask, is Johnny Mo.

374
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,120
The head general of O-ren's personal army,

375
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:37,760
the crazy 88.

376
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,040
And just in case you're wondering

377
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:43,680
how could a half-breed-Japanese-Chinese-American

378
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,520
become the boss of bosses in Tokyo, Japan,

379
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,120
I'll tell you.

380
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,960
The subject of O-ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once,

381
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,840
the night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council.

382
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,840
The man who seems bound and determined to break the mood

383
00:58:03,840 --> 00:58:05,680
is Boss Tanaka.

384
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:09,520
And what Boss Tanaka thinks is...

385
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,760
As your leader,

386
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,200
I encourage you from time to time

387
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,200
and always in a respectful manner,

388
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:28,720
to question my logic.

389
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,240
If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest,

390
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,320
tell me so.

391
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,960
But allow me to convince you.

392
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,040
And I promise you right here and now,

393
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:40,600
no subject will ever be taboo...

394
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:44,440
except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

395
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,000
The price you pay for bringing up

396
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,000
either my Chinese or my American heritage as a negative is,

397
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:55,000
I collect your fuckin head.

398
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:58,840
Just like this fucker here.

399
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:03,080
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say,

400
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:07,480
now's the fucking time.

401
01:01:08,360 --> 01:01:12,200
I didn't think so.

402
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:19,560
One ticket to Tokyo,please.

403
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:56,960
O-ren Ishii!

404
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:39,360
Mickey!

405
01:13:22,920 --> 01:13:26,760
So O-ren, any more subordinates for me to kill?

406
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,160
Bingo!

407
01:13:48,200 --> 01:13:52,040
GoGo, I know you feel you must protest your mistress.

408
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,160
But I beg you...walk away.

409
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:22,120
Is that what I think it is?

410
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:25,320
You didn't think that'd be that easy, did you?

411
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:28,680
You know, for a second there,

412
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:32,520
yeah, I kindof did.

413
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:36,640
Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids.

414
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,240
THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR FUNKING AROUND WITH YAKUZAS!

415
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:59,240
NOW GO HOME TO YOUR MOTHER

416
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:18,160
Except you Sofie,

417
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:22,000
you stay right where you are

418
01:26:12,960 --> 01:26:16,800
Your instrument is quite impressive.

419
01:29:40,080 --> 01:29:43,920
Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords.

420
01:29:46,640 --> 01:29:50,440
You may not be able to fight like a samurai,

421
01:29:52,480 --> 01:29:56,320
but you can at least die like a samurai.

422
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:46,120
Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie

423
01:34:47,840 --> 01:34:51,680
I'm so sorry.

424
01:34:53,320 --> 01:34:56,680
Please, please forgive my betrayal...

425
01:34:56,680 --> 01:34:58,560
No more of that...

426
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,400
But still, I ,I...

427
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:04,240
But still nothing,

428
01:35:05,326 --> 01:35:10,764
except my aching heart over what she's done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie.

429
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:17,461
I've kept you live for two reasons. First reason is information.

430
01:35:23,482 --> 01:35:26,750
But I am gonna to ask you questions.

431
01:35:27,000 --> 01:35:30,840
And every time you don't give me answers,

432
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:34,560
I'm gonna cut something off.

433
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:39,600
And I promise you, they will be things you will miss.

434
01:35:41,443 --> 01:35:44,790
GIVE ME YOUR ARM!

435
01:35:45,605 --> 01:35:51,191
I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers,

436
01:35:51,447 --> 01:35:55,685
what they've been doing and where I can find them.

437
01:35:55,880 --> 01:35:59,440
If you had to guess why she left you alive

438
01:35:59,440 --> 01:36:00,200
what would be your guess?

439
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:01,640
Guessing won't be necessary.

440
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:05,480
She informed me.

441
01:36:05,680 --> 01:36:09,520
She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons.

442
01:36:10,360 --> 01:36:11,720
As I said before,

443
01:36:11,720 --> 01:36:15,560
I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons.

444
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:18,720
And the second reason is,

445
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:21,600
So you can tell him, in person,

446
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,160
everything that happened here tonight.

447
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:28,600
I want you to witness the extent of my mercy

448
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:31,880
by witnessing your deformed body.

449
01:36:31,880 --> 01:36:33,120
I want you to tell him,

450
01:36:33,120 --> 01:36:36,000
all the information that you just told me.

451
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:39,080
I want him to know what I know.

452
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,920
I want him to know I want him to know.

453
01:36:43,000 --> 01:36:45,600
And I want them all to know,

454
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:49,440
they'll all soon be as dead as O-ren.

455
01:37:34,960 --> 01:37:38,800
That woman deserves her revenge.

456
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:47,520
And we deserve to die.

457
01:37:51,280 --> 01:37:55,120
She must suffer to her last breath.

458
01:38:07,200 --> 01:38:10,160
How did you find me?

459
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:14,000
I'm the man.

460
01:38:15,640 --> 01:38:19,400
One more thing Sofie

461
01:38:19,400 --> 01:38:23,240
is she aware her daughter is still alive?
