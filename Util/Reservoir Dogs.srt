1
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:08,739
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

2
00:00:08,821 --> 00:00:12,101
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,341
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:14,422 --> 00:00:15,822
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:15,902 --> 00:00:19,103
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:19,142 --> 00:00:22,423
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

7
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:25,783
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

8
00:00:25,863 --> 00:00:28,064
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

9
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:32,745
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

10
00:00:32,825 --> 00:00:35,426
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

11
00:00:35,465 --> 00:00:39,346
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:39,466 --> 00:00:42,867
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

13
00:00:42,947 --> 00:00:45,748
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

14
00:00:45,827 --> 00:00:48,268
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

15
00:00:48,348 --> 00:00:50,748
Personally, I can do without her.

16
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,908
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

17
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,909
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:58,830
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:01,071
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

20
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:04,431
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

21
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,152
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

22
00:01:07,232 --> 00:01:11,713
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:11,793 --> 00:01:14,873
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

24
00:01:14,954 --> 00:01:17,154
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--

25
00:01:17,194 --> 00:01:19,514
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

26
00:01:19,595 --> 00:01:22,155
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

27
00:01:22,195 --> 00:01:24,515
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

28
00:01:24,595 --> 00:01:27,516
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

29
00:01:27,557 --> 00:01:29,957
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

30
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:32,877
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

31
00:01:32,918 --> 00:01:35,157
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.

32
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:38,519
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

33
00:01:38,558 --> 00:01:42,200
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

34
00:01:42,279 --> 00:01:45,759
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

35
00:01:45,879 --> 00:01:50,321
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

36
00:01:50,401 --> 00:01:52,041
Chew? Toby Chew?

37
00:01:52,081 --> 00:01:54,361
It hurts. It hurts her.

38
00:01:54,402 --> 00:01:56,923
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

39
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:59,643
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

40
00:01:59,722 --> 00:02:02,844
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

41
00:02:02,923 --> 00:02:05,564
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

42
00:02:05,644 --> 00:02:07,724
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

43
00:02:07,804 --> 00:02:10,645
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

44
00:02:11,805 --> 00:02:13,326
Wong.

45
00:02:13,406 --> 00:02:17,566
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?

46
00:02:17,647 --> 00:02:20,727
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

47
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,327
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:23,407 --> 00:02:27,369
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

49
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:30,288
"Toby. Toby?

50
00:02:30,329 --> 00:02:32,610
Toby? Toby Wong.

51
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:34,890
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

52
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:37,891
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

53
00:02:37,971 --> 00:02:40,411
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

54
00:02:40,491 --> 00:02:44,412
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

55
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:47,013
Give me that book.

56
00:02:47,092 --> 00:02:49,013
Are you gonna put it away?

57
00:02:49,092 --> 00:02:52,653
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

58
00:02:52,733 --> 00:02:55,133
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

59
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:58,175
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

60
00:02:58,214 --> 00:02:59,175
Shit.

61
00:02:59,215 --> 00:03:03,296
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

62
00:03:07,177 --> 00:03:10,377
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

63
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:12,297
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

64
00:03:12,338 --> 00:03:15,218
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

65
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:18,218
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

66
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,859
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:20,939 --> 00:03:24,580
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

68
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,541
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

69
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:30,821
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,861
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

71
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:35,702
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

72
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,383
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:38,463 --> 00:03:42,383
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

74
00:03:42,424 --> 00:03:45,865
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

75
00:03:48,104 --> 00:03:50,346
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

76
00:03:50,425 --> 00:03:50,465
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

77
00:03:50,465 --> 00:03:54,186
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

78
00:03:54,227 --> 00:03:56,586
You guys can get the tip.

79
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,066
Should be about a buck apiece.

80
00:03:59,148 --> 00:04:02,348
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

81
00:04:02,387 --> 00:04:04,828
Sorry. It's my book now.

82
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:08,949
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

83
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:16,031
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

84
00:04:21,912 --> 00:04:24,153
Come on, throw in a buck.

85
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:25,872
I don't tip.

86
00:04:25,952 --> 00:04:28,633
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

87
00:04:28,713 --> 00:04:30,874
You don't believe in tipping?

88
00:04:30,994 --> 00:04:34,193
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

89
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,954
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

90
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,756
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

91
00:04:40,835 --> 00:04:43,555
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

92
00:04:43,675 --> 00:04:46,357
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

93
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:50,838
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

94
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:53,517
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

95
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,239
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

96
00:04:57,359 --> 00:04:59,199
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

97
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:01,600
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,280
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

99
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:09,881
I'd go over 12% for that.

100
00:05:09,962 --> 00:05:13,802
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

101
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:15,923
I want it filled six times.

102
00:05:16,003 --> 00:05:19,203
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

103
00:05:19,283 --> 00:05:22,404
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

104
00:05:22,483 --> 00:05:25,124
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

105
00:05:25,205 --> 00:05:26,645
another cup of coffee.

106
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:31,086
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

107
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:33,246
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

108
00:05:33,325 --> 00:05:36,206
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

109
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,407
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

110
00:05:40,887 --> 00:05:42,848
You know what this is?

111
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:45,648
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

112
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:49,170
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

113
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,570
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

114
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:56,011
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

115
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,611
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

116
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:02,452
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

117
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:04,732
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

118
00:06:04,813 --> 00:06:07,453
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

119
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,494
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

120
00:06:11,614 --> 00:06:13,575
The reason is
because of their tips.

121
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:16,254
Fuck all that.

122
00:06:19,095 --> 00:06:21,735
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

123
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:24,057
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

124
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:26,257
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

125
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:28,577
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

126
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:32,218
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

127
00:06:32,258 --> 00:06:34,898
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

128
00:06:35,019 --> 00:06:38,899
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

129
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:42,340
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

130
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:44,341
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

131
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:47,782
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

132
00:06:49,382 --> 00:06:52,382
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

133
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:55,183
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

134
00:06:55,262 --> 00:06:57,983
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

135
00:06:58,064 --> 00:07:00,704
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

136
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:02,704
He don't tip?

137
00:07:02,785 --> 00:07:04,705
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

138
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:08,065
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

139
00:07:08,146 --> 00:07:12,827
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

140
00:07:12,906 --> 00:07:16,787
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

141
00:07:18,908 --> 00:07:21,188
Never mind what you
normally would do.

142
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:25,709
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

143
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:31,951
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

144
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:34,111
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

145
00:07:34,151 --> 00:07:37,312
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

146
00:07:37,391 --> 00:07:41,031
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

147
00:07:41,112 --> 00:07:43,672
just keeps on truckin'.

148
00:07:43,672 --> 00:07:44,153
just keeps on truckin'.

149
00:09:27,454 --> 00:09:29,215
I'm gonna die.

150
00:09:30,534 --> 00:09:32,214
I'm gonna die!

151
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:35,175
Just hold on, buddy boy!

152
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,936
I'm gonna die!

153
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:42,297
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

154
00:09:42,337 --> 00:09:46,658
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

155
00:09:46,737 --> 00:09:51,258
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

156
00:09:51,378 --> 00:09:55,259
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

157
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:04,662
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

158
00:10:04,701 --> 00:10:07,182
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

159
00:10:07,262 --> 00:10:10,303
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

160
00:10:12,464 --> 00:10:14,504
Are you a doctor?

161
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,464
Are you a doctor?

162
00:10:16,503 --> 00:10:18,985
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

163
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:23,745
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

164
00:10:23,825 --> 00:10:26,867
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

165
00:10:26,946 --> 00:10:31,507
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

166
00:10:31,586 --> 00:10:34,987
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

167
00:10:35,027 --> 00:10:38,788
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

168
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:41,109
you're gonna be okay.

169
00:10:41,229 --> 00:10:44,589
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

170
00:10:44,669 --> 00:10:46,110
Say it!

171
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:49,030
You're gonna be okay!

172
00:10:49,071 --> 00:10:52,191
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

173
00:10:52,231 --> 00:10:53,711
Oh, God!

174
00:10:53,752 --> 00:10:55,871
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

175
00:10:55,952 --> 00:10:57,512
Say it!

176
00:10:57,592 --> 00:10:59,793
Okay, Larry.

177
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,753
Correct! Correct!

178
00:11:05,435 --> 00:11:07,393
I'm okay.

179
00:11:15,276 --> 00:11:17,716
Look where we are.

180
00:11:17,757 --> 00:11:20,477
Look where we are.

181
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:24,358
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

182
00:11:24,437 --> 00:11:26,358
We're in a warehouse.

183
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:30,719
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

184
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:34,640
Come on, who's a tough guy?

185
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,560
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

186
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,561
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

187
00:11:45,002 --> 00:11:47,763
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

188
00:11:47,802 --> 00:11:50,163
We made it. We made it.

189
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,564
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

190
00:11:55,645 --> 00:11:58,644
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

191
00:11:59,965 --> 00:12:02,046
Look where we are.

192
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:05,846
Hold on. Hold on.

193
00:12:07,167 --> 00:12:09,646
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

194
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:12,167
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

195
00:12:13,487 --> 00:12:16,008
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

196
00:12:17,328 --> 00:12:19,248
I can't do anything for you.

197
00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:21,809
But when Joe gets here...

198
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:23,849
which should be any time now...

199
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:27,050
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

200
00:12:27,131 --> 00:12:29,570
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

201
00:12:31,531 --> 00:12:35,051
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

202
00:12:39,453 --> 00:12:43,574
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

203
00:12:46,454 --> 00:12:49,375
Would you please hold me?

204
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,215
Yeah, sure.

205
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:19,821
You go ahead and be scared.

206
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:22,342
You've been brave enough
for one day.

207
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:29,704
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

208
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:32,143
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

209
00:13:32,224 --> 00:13:35,664
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

210
00:13:37,225 --> 00:13:39,905
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

211
00:13:40,785 --> 00:13:43,986
It's not good, no.

212
00:13:44,066 --> 00:13:45,466
Hey, Larry...

213
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,587
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

214
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:53,588
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

215
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:57,749
But I got my senses back now.

216
00:13:57,829 --> 00:14:00,909
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

217
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:04,110
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

218
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:11,232
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

219
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:15,872
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

220
00:14:15,952 --> 00:14:19,674
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

221
00:14:22,154 --> 00:14:26,434
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

222
00:14:26,474 --> 00:14:29,195
I swear to fucking God, man.

223
00:14:30,835 --> 00:14:34,436
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

224
00:14:35,636 --> 00:14:40,238
I won't tell them anything.

225
00:14:40,317 --> 00:14:42,278
You'll be safe, man.

226
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:47,719
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

227
00:14:47,799 --> 00:14:50,920
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

228
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,361
Along with the kneecap...

229
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,961
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

230
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,242
No shit!

231
00:14:58,321 --> 00:15:01,082
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

232
00:15:01,161 --> 00:15:03,562
I'm talkin' days.

233
00:15:03,642 --> 00:15:07,844
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

234
00:15:07,882 --> 00:15:09,643
Time is on your side.

235
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:12,003
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

236
00:15:13,484 --> 00:15:15,564
Shit. Orange got tagged?

237
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,405
Gut shot.

238
00:15:18,485 --> 00:15:20,765
Fuck. Where's Brown?

239
00:15:20,846 --> 00:15:22,166
Dead.

240
00:15:23,726 --> 00:15:25,727
How did he die?

241
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:29,007
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

242
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,168
This is bad.

243
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:34,969
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

244
00:15:35,048 --> 00:15:36,729
As opposed to good?

245
00:15:37,929 --> 00:15:40,049
Man, this is fucked up.

246
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:42,370
This is so fucked up.

247
00:15:42,449 --> 00:15:45,410
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

248
00:15:48,091 --> 00:15:52,051
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

249
00:15:52,133 --> 00:15:56,573
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

250
00:15:56,653 --> 00:15:59,094
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

251
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:02,415
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

252
00:16:02,534 --> 00:16:05,015
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

253
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:07,735
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

254
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:10,376
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

255
00:16:10,456 --> 00:16:13,417
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

256
00:16:13,496 --> 00:16:16,858
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

257
00:16:17,937 --> 00:16:20,818
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

258
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,538
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

259
00:16:23,619 --> 00:16:26,058
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

260
00:16:26,139 --> 00:16:28,620
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

261
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:31,419
I haven't had a chance to think.

262
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:34,781
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

263
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,941
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

264
00:16:38,022 --> 00:16:40,341
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

265
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:43,263
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

266
00:16:43,342 --> 00:16:45,943
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

267
00:16:46,023 --> 00:16:49,784
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

268
00:16:53,504 --> 00:16:56,785
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

269
00:16:56,825 --> 00:16:59,426
Larry, don't leave me.

270
00:17:03,826 --> 00:17:07,428
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

271
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:10,107
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

272
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,668
I'm right over there.

273
00:17:16,949 --> 00:17:18,830
Larry...

274
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,151
I'm gonna fucking die.

275
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,991
Larry.

276
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,432
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

277
00:17:27,552 --> 00:17:29,632
I felt funny about
this job right off.

278
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:33,432
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

279
00:17:33,513 --> 00:17:35,793
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

280
00:17:35,874 --> 00:17:38,554
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

281
00:17:38,633 --> 00:17:41,514
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

282
00:17:41,554 --> 00:17:44,955
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

283
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:48,196
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

284
00:17:48,276 --> 00:17:51,076
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

285
00:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,077
Are you cool?

286
00:17:55,237 --> 00:17:56,838
I'm cool.

287
00:17:58,358 --> 00:18:00,878
Splash some water on your face.

288
00:18:04,558 --> 00:18:06,478
Take a breather.

289
00:18:20,882 --> 00:18:24,043
Relax. Have a cigarette.

290
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:26,123
I quit.

291
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:28,884
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

292
00:19:01,770 --> 00:19:05,331
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

293
00:19:05,411 --> 00:19:07,932
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

294
00:19:08,012 --> 00:19:10,172
Then the alarm gets tripped.

295
00:19:11,613 --> 00:19:14,614
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

296
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:20,094
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

297
00:19:20,174 --> 00:19:24,536
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

298
00:19:24,615 --> 00:19:27,616
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

299
00:19:27,696 --> 00:19:31,377
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

300
00:19:31,457 --> 00:19:35,057
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

301
00:19:35,138 --> 00:19:38,257
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

302
00:19:38,378 --> 00:19:42,179
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

303
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:45,219
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

304
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:49,181
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

305
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,221
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

306
00:19:52,301 --> 00:19:55,621
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

307
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:59,383
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

308
00:19:59,463 --> 00:20:02,063
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

309
00:20:07,384 --> 00:20:09,704
You're right.
This is bad.

310
00:20:14,946 --> 00:20:18,546
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

311
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:21,066
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

312
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:29,148
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

313
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,749
Get the fuck outta the way!

314
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,110
Move it!
Get outta the way!

315
00:20:41,751 --> 00:20:44,872
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

316
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:48,193
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

317
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:49,232
Move!

318
00:20:56,674 --> 00:20:57,874
Jesus!

319
00:20:57,955 --> 00:21:00,355
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

320
00:21:00,475 --> 00:21:02,635
Move it!
Move outta the way!

321
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,241
I tagged a couple of cops.

322
00:21:34,321 --> 00:21:36,402
Did you kill anybody?

323
00:21:36,482 --> 00:21:39,643
- A few cops.
- No real people?

324
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,683
Just cops.

325
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:55,046
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

326
00:21:56,527 --> 00:21:59,527
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

327
00:21:59,566 --> 00:22:02,287
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

328
00:22:02,368 --> 00:22:03,968
I don't want to kill anybody.

329
00:22:04,048 --> 00:22:06,648
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

330
00:22:06,689 --> 00:22:09,168
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

331
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:11,569
That's the way I look at it.

332
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:14,250
The choice between
doin' ten years...

333
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,130
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

334
00:22:18,131 --> 00:22:20,251
ain't no choice at all.

335
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:23,012
But I ain't no madman, either.

336
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:26,732
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

337
00:22:29,253 --> 00:22:32,653
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

338
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:36,695
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

339
00:22:36,774 --> 00:22:39,815
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

340
00:22:39,896 --> 00:22:42,536
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

341
00:22:42,616 --> 00:22:46,376
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

342
00:22:46,417 --> 00:22:50,298
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

343
00:22:50,377 --> 00:22:54,539
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

344
00:22:54,618 --> 00:22:57,739
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

345
00:22:57,819 --> 00:23:01,980
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

346
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:06,621
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

347
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,261
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

348
00:23:11,221 --> 00:23:15,582
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

349
00:23:15,622 --> 00:23:17,942
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

350
00:23:19,944 --> 00:23:22,584
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

351
00:23:23,864 --> 00:23:27,345
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

352
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:29,584
After that,
I don't know what went down.

353
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,626
It was every man for himself.

354
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:34,626
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

355
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,947
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

356
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:39,027
What do you think?

357
00:23:39,107 --> 00:23:42,348
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

358
00:23:44,148 --> 00:23:46,829
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

359
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:49,229
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

360
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:53,070
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

361
00:23:53,150 --> 00:23:56,511
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

362
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:59,951
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

363
00:24:01,431 --> 00:24:03,912
I got the diamonds.

364
00:24:11,554 --> 00:24:13,873
That's my boy.

365
00:24:13,955 --> 00:24:16,634
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

366
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:20,955
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

367
00:24:21,036 --> 00:24:24,636
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

368
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,796
That was the plan.
We meet here.

369
00:24:26,878 --> 00:24:28,798
Then where the fuck is everybody?

370
00:24:28,877 --> 00:24:31,958
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

371
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,119
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

372
00:24:35,199 --> 00:24:37,559
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

373
00:24:37,639 --> 00:24:40,560
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

374
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:44,240
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

375
00:24:52,202 --> 00:24:55,963
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

376
00:24:56,043 --> 00:24:57,963
What?

377
00:24:59,723 --> 00:25:02,805
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

378
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:05,285
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

379
00:25:07,245 --> 00:25:08,885
No shit?

380
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:12,566
Thank God we discovered in time.

381
00:25:12,647 --> 00:25:15,728
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

382
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,967
So who's the rat this time?

383
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:21,007
Mr. Blue?

384
00:25:21,089 --> 00:25:22,848
Mr. Brown?

385
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:27,089
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

386
00:25:27,169 --> 00:25:30,650
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

387
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:34,050
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

388
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,732
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

389
00:25:38,851 --> 00:25:41,933
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

390
00:25:42,012 --> 00:25:45,453
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

391
00:25:45,493 --> 00:25:47,654
For all I know, you're the rat.

392
00:25:47,733 --> 00:25:50,093
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

393
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:52,534
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

394
00:25:52,614 --> 00:25:55,055
For all we know, he's the rat.

395
00:25:55,134 --> 00:25:58,415
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

396
00:25:58,496 --> 00:26:00,615
so don't you be calling him a rat!

397
00:26:00,656 --> 00:26:03,016
Look, I'm right, okay?

398
00:26:03,096 --> 00:26:05,577
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

399
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:12,978
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

400
00:26:15,859 --> 00:26:18,700
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...

401
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,700
and make a right.

402
00:26:28,341 --> 00:26:32,143
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

403
00:26:32,182 --> 00:26:35,823
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

404
00:26:35,903 --> 00:26:38,383
But I thought you two
were a team.

405
00:26:39,424 --> 00:26:41,384
We were for a little while.

406
00:26:41,425 --> 00:26:45,065
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

407
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,704
Why?

408
00:26:49,866 --> 00:26:53,627
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

409
00:26:53,706 --> 00:26:55,827
What's she doin' now?

410
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:59,428
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

411
00:26:59,508 --> 00:27:01,668
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

412
00:27:05,349 --> 00:27:09,030
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

413
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:11,350
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

414
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:14,391
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

415
00:27:14,511 --> 00:27:16,711
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

416
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:20,072
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

417
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:22,633
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

418
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:25,952
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

419
00:27:26,034 --> 00:27:27,473
Bad luck.

420
00:27:27,553 --> 00:27:29,393
I guess you can say that again.

421
00:27:30,314 --> 00:27:32,234
What's the exposure like?

422
00:27:32,315 --> 00:27:35,235
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

423
00:27:35,275 --> 00:27:38,716
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

424
00:27:38,796 --> 00:27:41,237
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

425
00:27:41,316 --> 00:27:44,197
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

426
00:27:44,277 --> 00:27:46,038
Security pretty lax.

427
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:48,477
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

428
00:27:48,558 --> 00:27:51,559
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

429
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:56,319
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

430
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,680
They're like a way station,
you know?

431
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,081
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.

432
00:28:05,601 --> 00:28:07,562
What's the cut, poppa?

433
00:28:07,642 --> 00:28:11,282
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

434
00:28:13,883 --> 00:28:16,523
Look, man, you do what you want.

435
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:19,404
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

436
00:28:19,483 --> 00:28:22,484
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

437
00:28:22,566 --> 00:28:25,166
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

438
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:29,446
Huh? ls he dead or what?

439
00:28:30,926 --> 00:28:33,887
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

440
00:28:33,968 --> 00:28:36,647
I think he's just passed out.

441
00:28:36,688 --> 00:28:40,809
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

442
00:28:40,848 --> 00:28:43,689
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

443
00:28:44,769 --> 00:28:47,730
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

444
00:28:49,331 --> 00:28:53,291
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

445
00:28:53,371 --> 00:28:56,131
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

446
00:28:56,211 --> 00:29:00,012
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

447
00:29:00,093 --> 00:29:03,892
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

448
00:29:03,974 --> 00:29:06,574
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

449
00:29:06,653 --> 00:29:10,854
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

450
00:29:10,894 --> 00:29:13,254
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

451
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:16,336
You got an idea, spit it out.

452
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,216
Joe could help.

453
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:23,057
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

454
00:29:23,137 --> 00:29:26,137
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

455
00:29:26,218 --> 00:29:30,339
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

456
00:29:30,418 --> 00:29:34,379
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

457
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:38,220
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

458
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,860
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

459
00:29:40,941 --> 00:29:44,301
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

460
00:29:44,381 --> 00:29:47,103
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

461
00:29:47,182 --> 00:29:51,904
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

462
00:29:55,583 --> 00:29:58,384
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

463
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:02,224
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

464
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:07,306
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

465
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:10,107
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

466
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:13,028
He begged me to do it.

467
00:30:13,107 --> 00:30:17,028
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

468
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:19,309
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

469
00:30:19,388 --> 00:30:22,069
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

470
00:30:22,149 --> 00:30:23,749
He knows a little about me.

471
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:30,190
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

472
00:30:30,271 --> 00:30:33,351
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

473
00:30:33,432 --> 00:30:34,871
Why?

474
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:39,033
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

475
00:30:39,112 --> 00:30:41,833
It was just
a natural conversation.

476
00:30:41,914 --> 00:30:44,913
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

477
00:30:44,995 --> 00:30:46,554
He asked.

478
00:30:48,034 --> 00:30:51,635
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

479
00:30:51,675 --> 00:30:55,116
It was my fault he got shot.

480
00:30:55,195 --> 00:30:57,636
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

481
00:30:57,716 --> 00:31:00,157
He's screamin'.

482
00:31:00,197 --> 00:31:03,397
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

483
00:31:03,478 --> 00:31:07,398
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

484
00:31:07,479 --> 00:31:11,079
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

485
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:13,480
And he asked me
what my name was.

486
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:19,841
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

487
00:31:21,321 --> 00:31:26,122
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

488
00:31:26,201 --> 00:31:29,202
It's against the rules?

489
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:32,203
I don't trust you enough?

490
00:31:32,283 --> 00:31:35,524
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

491
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:38,045
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

492
00:31:38,124 --> 00:31:41,366
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

493
00:31:41,445 --> 00:31:43,886
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

494
00:31:43,926 --> 00:31:46,246
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

495
00:31:46,327 --> 00:31:49,207
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

496
00:31:49,247 --> 00:31:53,568
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

497
00:31:53,648 --> 00:31:56,928
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

498
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:00,569
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

499
00:32:00,649 --> 00:32:04,250
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

500
00:32:04,329 --> 00:32:07,251
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

501
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:09,010
If we don't, he's gonna die.

502
00:32:09,092 --> 00:32:12,172
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

503
00:32:12,252 --> 00:32:14,892
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

504
00:32:20,294 --> 00:32:22,373
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

505
00:32:22,454 --> 00:32:24,574
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

506
00:32:24,654 --> 00:32:27,735
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

507
00:32:27,815 --> 00:32:31,576
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

508
00:32:31,655 --> 00:32:34,456
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

509
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,497
and that can't happen!

510
00:32:36,576 --> 00:32:39,297
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

511
00:32:39,377 --> 00:32:41,897
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

512
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:44,578
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

513
00:32:44,658 --> 00:32:46,858
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

514
00:32:46,939 --> 00:32:50,339
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

515
00:32:50,419 --> 00:32:53,340
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

516
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,260
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

517
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:57,980
Mr. Blonde.

518
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:02,382
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

519
00:33:07,183 --> 00:33:10,983
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

520
00:33:14,584 --> 00:33:17,304
Hey, you okay?

521
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,946
Did you see what happened to Blue?

522
00:33:21,025 --> 00:33:24,626
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

523
00:33:26,707 --> 00:33:29,467
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

524
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:31,827
Enough! Enough!

525
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:34,988
You better start talkin', asshole.

526
00:33:35,028 --> 00:33:37,908
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

527
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,710
We're already freaked out.

528
00:33:39,789 --> 00:33:43,190
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

529
00:33:44,069 --> 00:33:45,991
Okay, let's talk.

530
00:33:46,071 --> 00:33:48,512
We think we got
a rat in the house.

531
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,591
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

532
00:33:50,672 --> 00:33:52,472
What makes you say that?

533
00:33:52,551 --> 00:33:54,512
Is that supposed to be funny?

534
00:33:54,592 --> 00:33:57,352
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

535
00:33:57,433 --> 00:34:00,193
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

536
00:34:00,274 --> 00:34:02,514
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

537
00:34:03,394 --> 00:34:06,115
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

538
00:34:06,195 --> 00:34:09,355
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

539
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:12,196
Fuck you, maniac!

540
00:34:15,037 --> 00:34:16,997
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

541
00:34:17,077 --> 00:34:19,638
What's this guy's problem?

542
00:34:19,717 --> 00:34:22,638
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

543
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:25,518
I got a big fuckin' problem...

544
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:28,599
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

545
00:34:30,439 --> 00:34:34,161
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

546
00:34:35,401 --> 00:34:37,602
In the store! Remember?

547
00:34:37,681 --> 00:34:42,482
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

548
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:44,523
You almost killed me!

549
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:46,923
Asshole!

550
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:53,324
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

551
00:34:54,884 --> 00:34:58,405
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

552
00:34:58,526 --> 00:35:00,486
or are you gonna bite?

553
00:35:00,526 --> 00:35:02,647
What was that?

554
00:35:05,167 --> 00:35:09,088
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

555
00:35:09,168 --> 00:35:12,929
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

556
00:35:14,128 --> 00:35:16,009
or are you gonna bite?

557
00:35:16,129 --> 00:35:19,090
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

558
00:35:19,169 --> 00:35:22,730
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

559
00:35:22,810 --> 00:35:25,171
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

560
00:35:25,251 --> 00:35:28,531
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

561
00:35:28,612 --> 00:35:30,532
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

562
00:35:30,612 --> 00:35:33,173
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

563
00:35:33,252 --> 00:35:36,934
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

564
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:39,814
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?

565
00:35:39,894 --> 00:35:42,894
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

566
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:46,895
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

567
00:35:48,655 --> 00:35:51,816
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

568
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:55,777
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

569
00:35:55,857 --> 00:35:59,618
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

570
00:36:02,057 --> 00:36:03,819
Wow.

571
00:36:03,939 --> 00:36:06,020
That was really exciting.

572
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,859
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

573
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:16,221
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

574
00:36:17,861 --> 00:36:22,623
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

575
00:36:22,703 --> 00:36:27,544
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

576
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,464
Follow you? Where?

577
00:36:30,464 --> 00:36:32,065
To my car.

578
00:36:33,265 --> 00:36:35,705
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

579
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:39,546
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

580
00:36:39,586 --> 00:36:41,586
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

581
00:36:41,666 --> 00:36:44,627
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

582
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,910
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

583
00:36:56,950 --> 00:36:59,390
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

584
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,830
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

585
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:07,432
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

586
00:37:07,511 --> 00:37:10,832
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

587
00:37:10,912 --> 00:37:14,113
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

588
00:37:14,233 --> 00:37:16,993
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

589
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:20,274
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

590
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:22,835
So in the meantime...

591
00:37:22,915 --> 00:37:25,596
I'll show you guys somethin'.

592
00:37:30,196 --> 00:37:31,757
Jesus Christ.

593
00:37:31,877 --> 00:37:34,877
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

594
00:37:34,957 --> 00:37:38,277
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

595
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:41,319
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

596
00:37:41,398 --> 00:37:43,438
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

597
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,081
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

598
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,440
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

599
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,001
I know you'll pay me back.

600
00:37:53,081 --> 00:37:56,842
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

601
00:37:56,921 --> 00:38:01,002
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

602
00:38:01,083 --> 00:38:06,004
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.

603
00:38:06,044 --> 00:38:08,644
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

604
00:38:08,724 --> 00:38:10,764
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

605
00:38:10,884 --> 00:38:13,605
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

606
00:38:13,685 --> 00:38:16,165
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

607
00:38:16,206 --> 00:38:18,846
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

608
00:38:23,447 --> 00:38:25,887
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

609
00:38:27,007 --> 00:38:29,249
How does freedom feel, huh?

610
00:38:29,328 --> 00:38:32,529
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

611
00:38:32,608 --> 00:38:35,530
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

612
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:37,529
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

613
00:38:37,611 --> 00:38:40,610
How about a little Remy Martin?

614
00:38:40,691 --> 00:38:42,651
Sure.

615
00:38:42,731 --> 00:38:44,771
Who's your parole officer?

616
00:38:46,092 --> 00:38:48,172
Seymour Scagnetti.

617
00:38:48,252 --> 00:38:50,773
How is he?

618
00:38:50,853 --> 00:38:52,773
He's a fuckin' asshole.

619
00:38:52,893 --> 00:38:54,813
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

620
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,494
It never ceases to amaze me.

621
00:38:57,574 --> 00:39:01,775
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

622
00:39:01,855 --> 00:39:04,695
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

623
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:08,376
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

624
00:39:10,416 --> 00:39:13,898
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

625
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,898
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

626
00:39:15,938 --> 00:39:17,938
Forget about you?

627
00:39:17,978 --> 00:39:20,898
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

628
00:39:20,939 --> 00:39:24,579
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

629
00:39:24,659 --> 00:39:27,620
Thanks a lot, Joe.

630
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,140
Ah, Vic.

631
00:39:32,421 --> 00:39:34,342
Toothpick Vic.

632
00:39:36,062 --> 00:39:40,023
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

633
00:39:40,103 --> 00:39:43,543
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

634
00:39:43,623 --> 00:39:46,064
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

635
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:54,065
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

636
00:39:54,146 --> 00:39:56,786
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.

637
00:39:56,866 --> 00:39:59,107
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

638
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:02,306
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

639
00:40:02,388 --> 00:40:04,308
That I should've picked you up?

640
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:07,069
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

641
00:40:09,349 --> 00:40:11,430
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...

642
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:15,190
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

643
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,870
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

644
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,950
He's ruining the business.

645
00:40:21,031 --> 00:40:24,911
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

646
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:28,153
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

647
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:31,033
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

648
00:40:31,113 --> 00:40:34,874
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

649
00:40:34,953 --> 00:40:37,875
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

650
00:40:37,954 --> 00:40:39,194
That's very true.

651
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,996
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

652
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:49,356
Come on, this ain't a playground!

653
00:40:53,318 --> 00:40:58,398
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

654
00:40:58,478 --> 00:41:01,319
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

655
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,480
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

656
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:06,201
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

657
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,721
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

658
00:41:08,801 --> 00:41:12,042
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

659
00:41:12,082 --> 00:41:14,362
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

660
00:41:14,402 --> 00:41:16,603
I don't think of you that way.

661
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,803
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

662
00:41:22,764 --> 00:41:27,364
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

663
00:41:27,445 --> 00:41:30,846
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

664
00:41:30,925 --> 00:41:35,286
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

665
00:41:35,366 --> 00:41:38,727
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

666
00:41:38,807 --> 00:41:40,407
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

667
00:41:40,487 --> 00:41:43,728
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

668
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:46,809
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

669
00:41:46,849 --> 00:41:49,369
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

670
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:52,290
and it's comin' out your mouth!

671
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:56,250
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

672
00:41:56,290 --> 00:41:59,171
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

673
00:41:59,251 --> 00:42:01,452
Now both of you, sit down.

674
00:42:06,612 --> 00:42:08,772
Now, Eddie...

675
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:11,813
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

676
00:42:12,974 --> 00:42:14,933
Vic here's got a parole problem.

677
00:42:15,014 --> 00:42:17,935
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

678
00:42:17,975 --> 00:42:20,616
Scagnetti. Fuck.

679
00:42:20,696 --> 00:42:24,737
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

680
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:28,056
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

681
00:42:28,137 --> 00:42:30,457
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

682
00:42:33,938 --> 00:42:35,938
Well, I wanna.

683
00:42:36,019 --> 00:42:38,859
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

684
00:42:38,939 --> 00:42:42,340
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

685
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,580
before I can move out on my own.

686
00:42:45,661 --> 00:42:48,981
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

687
00:42:49,021 --> 00:42:51,461
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

688
00:42:51,542 --> 00:42:53,462
every fuckin' night.

689
00:42:53,542 --> 00:42:56,942
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

690
00:42:57,023 --> 00:42:58,944
This ain't all that bad.

691
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:02,104
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

692
00:43:02,183 --> 00:43:05,024
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

693
00:43:05,064 --> 00:43:08,385
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

694
00:43:08,464 --> 00:43:11,986
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

695
00:43:12,066 --> 00:43:15,067
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

696
00:43:15,147 --> 00:43:19,027
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

697
00:43:19,107 --> 00:43:22,987
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

698
00:43:23,069 --> 00:43:27,709
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

699
00:43:27,788 --> 00:43:30,429
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

700
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,750
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

701
00:43:32,830 --> 00:43:36,351
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

702
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,711
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

703
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:43,992
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

704
00:43:44,072 --> 00:43:45,672
You just missed him.

705
00:43:45,753 --> 00:43:49,233
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

706
00:43:49,314 --> 00:43:52,073
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

707
00:43:52,154 --> 00:43:55,755
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

708
00:43:55,795 --> 00:43:58,395
We got places all over the place.

709
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,755
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

710
00:44:00,837 --> 00:44:04,756
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

711
00:44:04,797 --> 00:44:08,757
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

712
00:44:10,278 --> 00:44:13,118
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

713
00:44:13,198 --> 00:44:15,919
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

714
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,279
you know, do some real work.

715
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:20,680
Well, it's hard to say.

716
00:44:20,759 --> 00:44:23,601
It's kind of a strange time now.

717
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:26,121
Things are kind of--

718
00:44:26,161 --> 00:44:29,242
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

719
00:44:29,322 --> 00:44:32,402
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

720
00:44:32,482 --> 00:44:37,043
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

721
00:44:37,123 --> 00:44:40,404
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

722
00:44:40,484 --> 00:44:43,645
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

723
00:44:43,725 --> 00:44:46,926
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

724
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:48,086
Huh?

725
00:44:48,166 --> 00:44:51,806
Dad, I got an idea.

726
00:44:51,885 --> 00:44:54,646
Just hear me out.

727
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:58,248
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

728
00:44:58,328 --> 00:45:02,768
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

729
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:05,809
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

730
00:45:07,049 --> 00:45:09,329
I'd like to have him in.

731
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:13,091
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

732
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:16,771
All right, Vic...

733
00:45:16,851 --> 00:45:20,932
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

734
00:45:23,612 --> 00:45:25,652
I'd feel great about it.

735
00:45:30,453 --> 00:45:34,134
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

736
00:45:34,214 --> 00:45:36,335
If you're the 12th caller...

737
00:45:36,415 --> 00:45:39,815
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

738
00:45:39,897 --> 00:45:43,177
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

739
00:45:43,256 --> 00:45:48,258
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

740
00:45:48,338 --> 00:45:53,218
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

741
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:01,860
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

742
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:05,421
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

743
00:46:13,262 --> 00:46:17,703
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

744
00:46:17,784 --> 00:46:20,264
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

745
00:46:20,344 --> 00:46:22,304
Get up! Get up!

746
00:46:25,464 --> 00:46:27,625
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

747
00:46:27,706 --> 00:46:30,107
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

748
00:46:34,827 --> 00:46:36,748
I don't know who did what!

749
00:46:36,867 --> 00:46:39,988
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

750
00:46:40,068 --> 00:46:43,949
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

751
00:46:59,672 --> 00:47:02,633
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

752
00:47:03,833 --> 00:47:06,673
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

753
00:47:08,874 --> 00:47:12,115
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

754
00:47:13,555 --> 00:47:15,795
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

755
00:47:15,876 --> 00:47:17,916
Huh? Fuck you!

756
00:47:17,995 --> 00:47:20,476
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

757
00:47:20,557 --> 00:47:22,116
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

758
00:47:25,397 --> 00:47:28,157
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

759
00:47:28,238 --> 00:47:30,599
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

760
00:47:30,678 --> 00:47:33,639
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

761
00:47:33,719 --> 00:47:36,239
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

762
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,800
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

763
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,961
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

764
00:47:43,201 --> 00:47:45,241
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

765
00:47:45,321 --> 00:47:49,203
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

766
00:47:49,282 --> 00:47:51,683
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

767
00:47:51,762 --> 00:47:54,124
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

768
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:55,804
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

769
00:47:55,883 --> 00:47:57,563
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

770
00:47:57,644 --> 00:48:01,004
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

771
00:48:01,085 --> 00:48:04,365
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

772
00:48:04,445 --> 00:48:07,766
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

773
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:10,846
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

774
00:48:10,927 --> 00:48:13,687
I don't know, but somebody did.

775
00:48:14,967 --> 00:48:18,528
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

776
00:48:18,608 --> 00:48:21,609
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

777
00:48:21,689 --> 00:48:23,729
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

778
00:48:23,809 --> 00:48:26,209
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

779
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:29,210
Where's Joseph?

780
00:48:29,290 --> 00:48:31,491
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

781
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:35,972
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

782
00:48:36,092 --> 00:48:38,531
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

783
00:48:38,613 --> 00:48:40,093
What'd Joe say?

784
00:48:40,172 --> 00:48:42,092
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

785
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:45,094
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

786
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:49,215
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

787
00:48:49,294 --> 00:48:50,774
You ain't dying. He is.

788
00:48:50,856 --> 00:48:54,335
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

789
00:48:54,415 --> 00:48:56,176
Who?

790
00:48:56,255 --> 00:48:59,696
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

791
00:48:59,777 --> 00:49:03,657
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

792
00:49:03,738 --> 00:49:05,977
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

793
00:49:06,058 --> 00:49:07,938
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

794
00:49:08,018 --> 00:49:11,979
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

795
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:14,339
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

796
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:16,620
Either he's alive or he's dead...

797
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,701
or the cops got him
or they don't.

798
00:49:22,662 --> 00:49:25,182
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

799
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:27,182
Why are you beatin' on him?

800
00:49:27,261 --> 00:49:29,623
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

801
00:49:29,743 --> 00:49:33,903
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

802
00:49:33,984 --> 00:49:36,784
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

803
00:49:36,864 --> 00:49:39,064
Come on, man, think!

804
00:49:39,145 --> 00:49:42,585
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

805
00:49:42,666 --> 00:49:47,107
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

806
00:49:47,146 --> 00:49:48,747
I got a bag.

807
00:49:48,827 --> 00:49:52,868
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

808
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:55,227
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

809
00:49:55,308 --> 00:49:59,549
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

810
00:49:59,629 --> 00:50:00,629
Okay.

811
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:04,589
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

812
00:50:04,670 --> 00:50:07,391
White and Pink,
take a car each.

813
00:50:07,470 --> 00:50:11,031
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

814
00:50:11,111 --> 00:50:14,232
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

815
00:50:14,311 --> 00:50:16,231
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

816
00:50:16,313 --> 00:50:19,792
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

817
00:50:20,912 --> 00:50:23,154
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

818
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:26,114
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

819
00:50:26,194 --> 00:50:28,395
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

820
00:50:30,596 --> 00:50:33,035
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

821
00:50:33,075 --> 00:50:38,156
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

822
00:50:38,237 --> 00:50:41,237
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

823
00:50:41,317 --> 00:50:45,158
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

824
00:50:45,238 --> 00:50:47,398
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

825
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:50,880
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

826
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:53,520
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

827
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:55,400
Tell him!

828
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,041
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

829
00:50:59,241 --> 00:51:03,041
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

830
00:51:03,122 --> 00:51:05,881
bam, bam.

831
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,243
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

832
00:51:08,323 --> 00:51:11,444
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

833
00:51:11,523 --> 00:51:16,044
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

834
00:51:17,765 --> 00:51:19,845
My fuckin' hero.

835
00:51:21,525 --> 00:51:23,565
Thanks.

836
00:51:23,646 --> 00:51:26,407
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

837
00:51:26,486 --> 00:51:28,567
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

838
00:51:32,127 --> 00:51:34,448
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

839
00:51:34,488 --> 00:51:36,569
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

840
00:51:36,649 --> 00:51:38,729
I haven't been looking at you guys.

841
00:51:38,809 --> 00:51:41,250
Shut the fuck up, man!

842
00:51:41,289 --> 00:51:44,170
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

843
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:48,291
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

844
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:50,091
Now here's the news!

845
00:51:50,171 --> 00:51:53,251
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

846
00:51:53,292 --> 00:51:55,613
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

847
00:51:55,692 --> 00:51:57,853
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

848
00:51:57,932 --> 00:52:00,933
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

849
00:52:01,013 --> 00:52:03,134
Fine. Let's go.

850
00:52:23,858 --> 00:52:25,819
Alone at last.

851
00:52:47,262 --> 00:52:49,623
Guess what.

852
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,384
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

853
00:52:57,544 --> 00:53:00,305
Now, where were we?

854
00:53:01,786 --> 00:53:05,146
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

855
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:08,667
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

856
00:53:08,747 --> 00:53:10,987
They don't tell me anything.

857
00:53:12,548 --> 00:53:15,548
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

858
00:53:15,589 --> 00:53:17,869
Torture you?
That's a good--

859
00:53:17,949 --> 00:53:21,070
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

860
00:53:22,591 --> 00:53:25,751
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

861
00:53:27,351 --> 00:53:30,432
- My what?
- Your boss.

862
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,433
Excuse me, pal.

863
00:53:33,512 --> 00:53:37,513
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

864
00:53:37,593 --> 00:53:40,673
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

865
00:53:40,793 --> 00:53:43,274
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

866
00:53:43,355 --> 00:53:46,435
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

867
00:53:49,435 --> 00:53:51,636
Get that fuckin' shit off.

868
00:53:59,878 --> 00:54:02,959
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

869
00:54:04,479 --> 00:54:07,639
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...

870
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,600
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

871
00:54:13,601 --> 00:54:15,161
regardless.

872
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,520
Not to get information.

873
00:54:19,162 --> 00:54:21,122
It's amusing to me...

874
00:54:21,202 --> 00:54:23,602
to torture a cop.

875
00:54:23,643 --> 00:54:26,883
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

876
00:54:28,484 --> 00:54:30,684
All you can do is...

877
00:54:30,724 --> 00:54:32,924
pray for a quick death...

878
00:54:35,565 --> 00:54:38,125
which...

879
00:54:38,206 --> 00:54:40,406
you ain't gonna get.

880
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:57,410
Oh, God.

881
00:55:05,652 --> 00:55:09,691
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?

882
00:55:13,092 --> 00:55:15,373
It's my personal favorite.

883
00:55:21,575 --> 00:55:26,215
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

884
00:55:26,295 --> 00:55:30,416
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

885
00:55:30,497 --> 00:55:33,577
from April of 1974.

886
00:55:33,657 --> 00:55:35,577
That reached up to number five...

887
00:55:35,657 --> 00:55:39,058
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

888
00:56:28,068 --> 00:56:30,188
Hold still.

889
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:32,389
Hold still, you fuck.

890
00:56:52,833 --> 00:56:55,274
Was that good for you too?

891
00:56:55,993 --> 00:56:57,834
Hey, what's goin' on?

892
00:56:57,874 --> 00:56:59,354
You hear that?

893
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:12,277
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

894
00:58:56,498 --> 00:58:58,939
Don't! Stop! Stop!

895
00:59:00,338 --> 00:59:03,299
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

896
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:06,460
That burn a little bit?

897
00:59:07,340 --> 00:59:08,981
Don't! Stop!

898
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:13,662
Please stop.

899
00:59:13,702 --> 00:59:15,942
Just stop. Stop.

900
00:59:16,022 --> 00:59:17,943
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

901
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:19,622
Don't burn me, please.

902
00:59:22,864 --> 00:59:26,464
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

903
00:59:26,584 --> 00:59:28,505
I'm not gonna say anything.

904
00:59:30,584 --> 00:59:31,865
No! Please, no.

905
00:59:31,945 --> 00:59:33,466
- You all through?
- Stop!

906
00:59:33,545 --> 00:59:34,626
You all through?

907
00:59:34,705 --> 00:59:38,187
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

908
00:59:38,826 --> 00:59:39,987
You all done?

909
00:59:40,028 --> 00:59:41,986
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

910
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:48,081
Oh, shit.

911
01:00:50,121 --> 01:00:51,602
Hey, you.

912
01:00:54,482 --> 01:00:56,762
What's your name?

913
01:00:59,963 --> 01:01:01,203
Marvin.

914
01:01:03,284 --> 01:01:04,484
Marvin what?

915
01:01:08,765 --> 01:01:10,286
Marvin Nash.

916
01:01:16,807 --> 01:01:18,727
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

917
01:01:21,488 --> 01:01:24,449
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

918
01:01:26,328 --> 01:01:28,089
Yeah, I know.

919
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:32,169
You do?

920
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:36,651
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

921
01:01:37,770 --> 01:01:39,331
Newendyke.

922
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:42,532
Freddy Newendyke.

923
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:48,533
Frankie Ferchetti...

924
01:01:48,613 --> 01:01:52,494
introduced us
about five months ago.

925
01:01:55,414 --> 01:01:57,855
I don't remember that at all.

926
01:02:01,056 --> 01:02:02,976
I do.

927
01:02:05,977 --> 01:02:08,417
Freddy.

928
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:18,579
How do I look?

929
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,740
What?

930
01:02:30,382 --> 01:02:33,302
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

931
01:02:36,903 --> 01:02:38,504
That fuck.

932
01:02:41,063 --> 01:02:43,464
That sick fuck!

933
01:02:43,544 --> 01:02:46,465
That fuckin' bastard!

934
01:02:48,385 --> 01:02:51,826
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

935
01:02:51,905 --> 01:02:54,827
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

936
01:02:55,906 --> 01:02:58,987
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

937
01:02:59,068 --> 01:03:02,269
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

938
01:03:02,308 --> 01:03:04,828
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

939
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:07,109
I'm fuckin' deformed!

940
01:03:07,149 --> 01:03:08,749
Fuck you!

941
01:03:10,109 --> 01:03:12,110
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

942
01:03:12,230 --> 01:03:14,311
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

943
01:03:22,711 --> 01:03:26,753
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

944
01:03:26,832 --> 01:03:29,634
I was sent in to get him.

945
01:03:29,674 --> 01:03:31,273
All right?

946
01:03:31,355 --> 01:03:34,315
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

947
01:03:34,354 --> 01:03:36,836
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

948
01:03:38,756 --> 01:03:41,036
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

949
01:03:41,115 --> 01:03:44,556
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

950
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:07,521
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

951
01:04:07,601 --> 01:04:10,442
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

952
01:04:10,522 --> 01:04:13,003
This better not be a joke.

953
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:16,764
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

954
01:04:24,364 --> 01:04:27,286
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

955
01:04:27,406 --> 01:04:31,325
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

956
01:04:31,407 --> 01:04:35,727
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

957
01:04:35,807 --> 01:04:38,808
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

958
01:04:38,887 --> 01:04:41,528
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

959
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:43,128
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

960
01:04:43,649 --> 01:04:44,729
We get there...

961
01:04:44,809 --> 01:04:47,809
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

962
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:49,850
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

963
01:04:49,930 --> 01:04:52,650
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

964
01:04:53,931 --> 01:04:55,851
Okay, Mr. Orange.

965
01:04:55,931 --> 01:04:59,611
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

966
01:04:59,692 --> 01:05:01,292
Yes. Mr. White.

967
01:05:02,012 --> 01:05:06,933
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

968
01:05:07,014 --> 01:05:09,174
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

969
01:05:09,254 --> 01:05:12,255
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

970
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:14,454
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

971
01:05:15,336 --> 01:05:16,535
Mr. White.

972
01:05:16,616 --> 01:05:18,176
- A little.
- About what?

973
01:05:18,255 --> 01:05:19,336
The Brewers.

974
01:05:19,416 --> 01:05:20,776
Milwaukee Brewers?

975
01:05:20,856 --> 01:05:23,937
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

976
01:05:24,057 --> 01:05:28,818
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

977
01:05:28,938 --> 01:05:31,698
And I'll bet you everything...

978
01:05:31,779 --> 01:05:34,899
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

979
01:05:34,979 --> 01:05:39,260
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

980
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:42,781
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

981
01:05:42,861 --> 01:05:45,341
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

982
01:05:46,622 --> 01:05:49,102
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

983
01:05:49,142 --> 01:05:53,423
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

984
01:05:53,502 --> 01:05:56,424
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

985
01:05:56,503 --> 01:05:59,423
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

986
01:05:59,505 --> 01:06:01,824
and that I was ready to move.

987
01:06:01,905 --> 01:06:04,585
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

988
01:06:06,665 --> 01:06:09,066
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

989
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:11,387
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

990
01:06:11,466 --> 01:06:13,386
He's selling out his friends.

991
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:16,267
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

992
01:06:16,347 --> 01:06:18,308
I'll take care of his ass...

993
01:06:18,388 --> 01:06:22,229
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

994
01:06:22,308 --> 01:06:23,909
Gone.

995
01:06:29,670 --> 01:06:31,630
Use the commode story?

996
01:06:31,711 --> 01:06:35,151
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

997
01:06:37,111 --> 01:06:40,432
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

998
01:06:40,512 --> 01:06:43,712
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

999
01:06:43,794 --> 01:06:46,553
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1000
01:06:46,593 --> 01:06:51,555
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

1001
01:06:51,635 --> 01:06:52,995
What is this?

1002
01:06:53,074 --> 01:06:55,996
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1003
01:06:58,115 --> 01:07:02,356
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

1004
01:07:02,397 --> 01:07:05,797
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

1005
01:07:05,878 --> 01:07:08,558
Think about it like it's a joke.

1006
01:07:08,598 --> 01:07:11,759
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

1007
01:07:11,838 --> 01:07:13,759
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

1008
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,840
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

1009
01:07:16,919 --> 01:07:18,840
and tell a joke, all right?

1010
01:07:18,921 --> 01:07:21,720
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

1011
01:07:21,761 --> 01:07:23,760
The details sell your story.

1012
01:07:23,842 --> 01:07:26,882
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

1013
01:07:26,961 --> 01:07:29,602
You gotta know
all the details--

1014
01:07:29,683 --> 01:07:33,523
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

1015
01:07:33,603 --> 01:07:37,284
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

1016
01:07:37,325 --> 01:07:40,405
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

1017
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:42,445
they used in high school.

1018
01:07:42,485 --> 01:07:45,445
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

1019
01:07:45,485 --> 01:07:48,886
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

1020
01:07:48,967 --> 01:07:51,367
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1021
01:07:51,447 --> 01:07:54,848
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1022
01:07:54,927 --> 01:07:59,809
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

1023
01:07:59,888 --> 01:08:03,770
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

1024
01:08:03,810 --> 01:08:07,050
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

1025
01:08:07,170 --> 01:08:09,050
The only way to do that...

1026
01:08:10,171 --> 01:08:12,091
is keep sayin' it...

1027
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:14,571
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1028
01:08:18,053 --> 01:08:22,892
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.

1029
01:08:22,974 --> 01:08:26,333
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

1030
01:08:26,374 --> 01:08:28,575
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

1031
01:08:30,135 --> 01:08:34,056
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1032
01:08:34,135 --> 01:08:36,055
and all my friends knew it.

1033
01:08:36,136 --> 01:08:38,816
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"

1034
01:08:40,497 --> 01:08:42,618
I say, "Hey, dude.

1035
01:08:43,858 --> 01:08:46,858
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

1036
01:08:46,938 --> 01:08:51,699
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

1037
01:08:51,739 --> 01:08:53,219
It got to be--

1038
01:08:58,860 --> 01:09:03,262
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1039
01:09:03,342 --> 01:09:07,943
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1040
01:09:08,022 --> 01:09:11,384
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

1041
01:09:11,463 --> 01:09:13,383
I was doing all the work.

1042
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:17,824
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

1043
01:09:17,904 --> 01:09:21,585
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

1044
01:09:21,665 --> 01:09:23,746
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

1045
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,226
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

1046
01:09:26,306 --> 01:09:28,267
When I get some,
I'll call you."

1047
01:09:29,347 --> 01:09:31,748
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

1048
01:09:31,827 --> 01:09:34,308
They're my friends and everything,
but still--

1049
01:09:34,388 --> 01:09:37,749
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1050
01:09:37,789 --> 01:09:41,189
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1051
01:09:41,269 --> 01:09:44,870
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1052
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:47,111
This was a very weird situation.

1053
01:09:48,311 --> 01:09:50,512
Remember back in '86...

1054
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:52,951
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

1055
01:09:53,032 --> 01:09:54,431
Nobody had anything.

1056
01:09:54,513 --> 01:09:57,833
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1057
01:09:57,913 --> 01:10:01,834
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1058
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:04,833
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

1059
01:10:04,915 --> 01:10:08,796
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

1060
01:10:08,875 --> 01:10:11,435
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

1061
01:10:11,475 --> 01:10:13,436
ten percent
and free pot for me...

1062
01:10:13,475 --> 01:10:15,436
if I helped her
that weekend.

1063
01:10:15,476 --> 01:10:18,797
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1064
01:10:18,837 --> 01:10:22,358
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1065
01:10:22,438 --> 01:10:23,517
What for?

1066
01:10:23,598 --> 01:10:25,438
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

1067
01:10:25,478 --> 01:10:29,319
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

1068
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:32,319
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1069
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,161
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1070
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:38,201
She keeps asking me, asking me.

1071
01:10:38,281 --> 01:10:41,202
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1072
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:43,562
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

1073
01:10:43,641 --> 01:10:46,643
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

1074
01:10:46,722 --> 01:10:48,882
The guy needed it right away.

1075
01:10:48,964 --> 01:10:51,324
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

1076
01:10:51,364 --> 01:10:53,324
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1077
01:10:53,364 --> 01:10:55,964
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

1078
01:10:56,004 --> 01:11:00,726
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1079
01:11:05,046 --> 01:11:08,007
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

1080
01:11:09,647 --> 01:11:13,088
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1081
01:11:15,289 --> 01:11:18,768
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

1082
01:11:18,849 --> 01:11:21,849
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

1083
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:24,290
and they looked at me.

1084
01:11:24,370 --> 01:11:27,171
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1085
01:11:28,212 --> 01:11:29,891
German shepherd starts barking.

1086
01:11:31,653 --> 01:11:33,171
He's barkin' at me.

1087
01:11:33,292 --> 01:11:35,853
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

1088
01:11:37,773 --> 01:11:41,574
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

1089
01:11:41,613 --> 01:11:45,614
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

1090
01:11:45,694 --> 01:11:48,215
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

1091
01:11:48,255 --> 01:11:49,735
Bam! Right in the face.

1092
01:11:49,855 --> 01:11:54,776
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

1093
01:11:54,856 --> 01:11:58,257
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1094
01:11:58,337 --> 01:12:00,258
They can smell it on me.

1095
01:12:01,138 --> 01:12:02,738
Shut up.

1096
01:12:04,098 --> 01:12:07,219
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

1097
01:12:07,259 --> 01:12:10,219
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

1098
01:12:10,259 --> 01:12:12,740
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

1099
01:12:12,780 --> 01:12:15,781
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

1100
01:12:15,821 --> 01:12:17,660
"I know, I know."

1101
01:12:17,742 --> 01:12:21,183
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

1102
01:12:21,262 --> 01:12:26,103
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1103
01:12:26,142 --> 01:12:28,264
Put your hands on the dash."

1104
01:12:28,303 --> 01:12:31,344
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

1105
01:12:31,424 --> 01:12:33,745
"I know, buddy, I know."

1106
01:12:33,824 --> 01:12:37,545
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

1107
01:12:37,626 --> 01:12:39,266
And I said...

1108
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:43,226
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

1109
01:12:43,306 --> 01:12:46,027
if you don't put your hands up."

1110
01:12:47,508 --> 01:12:51,628
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1111
01:12:51,667 --> 01:12:54,949
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

1112
01:12:54,988 --> 01:12:58,309
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1113
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:02,591
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

1114
01:13:02,670 --> 01:13:04,030
What was he goin' for?

1115
01:13:04,150 --> 01:13:06,390
His fucking registration.

1116
01:13:07,711 --> 01:13:09,312
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

1117
01:13:09,352 --> 01:13:12,993
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

1118
01:13:13,072 --> 01:13:14,512
That close, man.

1119
01:13:48,120 --> 01:13:50,081
You knew how to handle
that situation.

1120
01:13:50,119 --> 01:13:53,080
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

1121
01:13:55,641 --> 01:13:57,641
Tell me more about Cabot.

1122
01:13:57,722 --> 01:13:59,562
I don't know.

1123
01:13:59,601 --> 01:14:01,603
He's a cool guy.

1124
01:14:03,323 --> 01:14:06,002
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

1125
01:14:06,763 --> 01:14:08,964
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

1126
01:14:10,044 --> 01:14:11,964
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

1127
01:14:12,044 --> 01:14:13,964
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

1128
01:14:15,205 --> 01:14:16,445
Thing.

1129
01:14:17,086 --> 01:14:18,365
Motherfucker...

1130
01:14:18,446 --> 01:14:20,406
Iooks just like the Thing.

1131
01:14:24,647 --> 01:14:27,248
Hey! Showtime!

1132
01:14:27,287 --> 01:14:30,208
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

1133
01:14:30,287 --> 01:14:32,128
I'll be right down.

1134
01:14:33,608 --> 01:14:34,848
He'll be right down.

1135
01:15:54,865 --> 01:15:57,025
Don't pussy out on me now.

1136
01:15:57,066 --> 01:15:59,027
They don't know.

1137
01:15:59,065 --> 01:16:01,307
They don't know shit.

1138
01:16:01,386 --> 01:16:04,508
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

1139
01:16:04,546 --> 01:16:08,028
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

1140
01:16:15,389 --> 01:16:16,871
There goes our boy.

1141
01:16:16,909 --> 01:16:20,031
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

1142
01:16:20,110 --> 01:16:21,590
to work undercover.

1143
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,591
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

1144
01:16:40,634 --> 01:16:42,595
I know what I'm talking about.

1145
01:16:42,635 --> 01:16:45,315
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

1146
01:16:45,396 --> 01:16:46,836
There's a slight difference.

1147
01:16:46,916 --> 01:16:49,636
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

1148
01:16:49,756 --> 01:16:53,197
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1149
01:16:53,277 --> 01:16:56,118
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

1150
01:16:56,198 --> 01:16:58,757
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

1151
01:16:58,798 --> 01:17:01,600
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

1152
01:17:01,638 --> 01:17:06,079
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1153
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:09,640
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

1154
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:12,641
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

1155
01:17:12,720 --> 01:17:15,801
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

1156
01:17:15,881 --> 01:17:17,923
Tell you guys a story.

1157
01:17:17,962 --> 01:17:22,803
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

1158
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:24,924
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

1159
01:17:25,004 --> 01:17:28,524
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

1160
01:17:28,605 --> 01:17:30,525
Where was she from?
Compton?

1161
01:17:32,645 --> 01:17:34,086
She's from Ladora Heights.

1162
01:17:34,165 --> 01:17:36,566
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

1163
01:17:37,685 --> 01:17:39,966
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

1164
01:17:40,007 --> 01:17:42,607
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1165
01:17:42,688 --> 01:17:44,527
Anyway...

1166
01:17:44,567 --> 01:17:48,969
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1167
01:17:49,008 --> 01:17:53,850
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

1168
01:17:53,889 --> 01:17:56,851
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

1169
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:58,850
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

1170
01:17:58,931 --> 01:18:01,251
about the black female cop?

1171
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:04,252
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "

1172
01:18:06,372 --> 01:18:09,213
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

1173
01:18:09,252 --> 01:18:12,213
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

1174
01:18:12,254 --> 01:18:14,213
Pam Grier did the film.

1175
01:18:14,254 --> 01:18:18,935
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1176
01:18:19,014 --> 01:18:22,215
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

1177
01:18:22,256 --> 01:18:24,216
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

1178
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:27,576
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

1179
01:18:27,656 --> 01:18:29,056
Anne Francis.

1180
01:18:29,137 --> 01:18:31,817
No. That was Honey West.

1181
01:18:31,896 --> 01:18:33,657
Anne Francis is white.

1182
01:18:33,737 --> 01:18:37,978
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

1183
01:18:38,058 --> 01:18:40,619
We come into the club
one night...

1184
01:18:40,698 --> 01:18:42,620
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

1185
01:18:42,700 --> 01:18:45,860
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

1186
01:18:45,900 --> 01:18:48,581
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

1187
01:18:49,661 --> 01:18:51,661
Apparently Lady E...

1188
01:18:51,742 --> 01:18:55,061
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

1189
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:57,343
He used to do things to her.

1190
01:18:57,422 --> 01:18:59,383
Like what?
What would he do?

1191
01:18:59,462 --> 01:19:01,183
Beat her up?

1192
01:19:01,863 --> 01:19:04,104
I don't know.
He just did things.

1193
01:19:04,144 --> 01:19:07,864
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1194
01:19:07,945 --> 01:19:10,265
She waits for him to get drunk.

1195
01:19:10,385 --> 01:19:13,305
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

1196
01:19:13,345 --> 01:19:17,666
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

1197
01:19:17,747 --> 01:19:19,907
and glues his dick
to his belly.

1198
01:19:21,027 --> 01:19:22,788
Jesus Christ!

1199
01:19:22,868 --> 01:19:25,667
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

1200
01:19:25,749 --> 01:19:29,070
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

1201
01:19:30,389 --> 01:19:32,309
Was he all pissed off?

1202
01:19:34,350 --> 01:19:38,590
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1203
01:19:42,912 --> 01:19:46,832
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

1204
01:19:46,913 --> 01:19:49,833
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

1205
01:19:49,873 --> 01:19:51,834
Well, let me tell a joke.

1206
01:19:52,874 --> 01:19:55,594
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

1207
01:19:55,674 --> 01:19:57,514
San Quentin...

1208
01:19:57,595 --> 01:20:00,515
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

1209
01:20:00,595 --> 01:20:03,916
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

1210
01:20:03,995 --> 01:20:05,917
It's your fault, his fault--"

1211
01:20:06,037 --> 01:20:07,757
All that bullshit.

1212
01:20:07,837 --> 01:20:09,596
Finally somebody says...

1213
01:20:09,678 --> 01:20:11,917
"Wait a minute.

1214
01:20:11,997 --> 01:20:13,998
While we were
planning this caper...

1215
01:20:14,039 --> 01:20:16,558
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1216
01:20:16,639 --> 01:20:18,359
Got the message?

1217
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:22,560
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1218
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,201
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1219
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,681
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

1220
01:20:30,721 --> 01:20:32,802
Find me a different character
down there.

1221
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:35,203
Right now it's a matter
of business.

1222
01:20:36,403 --> 01:20:38,803
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

1223
01:20:38,883 --> 01:20:40,643
who you already know...

1224
01:20:40,723 --> 01:20:43,565
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

1225
01:20:43,603 --> 01:20:46,124
Under no circumstances...

1226
01:20:46,204 --> 01:20:49,365
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

1227
01:20:49,405 --> 01:20:51,646
by your Christian names.

1228
01:20:51,725 --> 01:20:56,127
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1229
01:20:56,206 --> 01:21:00,087
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

1230
01:21:00,167 --> 01:21:02,089
where you might've done time...

1231
01:21:02,168 --> 01:21:06,008
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1232
01:21:06,088 --> 01:21:10,009
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

1233
01:21:10,089 --> 01:21:12,690
is what you're gonna do.

1234
01:21:12,770 --> 01:21:14,930
That should do it.

1235
01:21:15,010 --> 01:21:17,451
These are your names--

1236
01:21:17,491 --> 01:21:20,452
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

1237
01:21:20,491 --> 01:21:22,932
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

1238
01:21:23,012 --> 01:21:25,213
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1239
01:21:25,292 --> 01:21:28,893
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

1240
01:21:30,734 --> 01:21:33,174
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1241
01:21:33,253 --> 01:21:35,935
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

1242
01:21:35,975 --> 01:21:39,414
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1243
01:21:39,455 --> 01:21:42,896
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1244
01:21:42,976 --> 01:21:45,297
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

1245
01:21:45,376 --> 01:21:47,498
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

1246
01:21:48,697 --> 01:21:50,977
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1247
01:21:51,058 --> 01:21:52,979
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1248
01:21:53,058 --> 01:21:54,938
How about Mr. Purple?

1249
01:21:54,978 --> 01:21:56,979
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1250
01:21:57,059 --> 01:21:59,499
You're not Mr. Purple.

1251
01:21:59,579 --> 01:22:03,821
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1252
01:22:03,900 --> 01:22:05,660
Who cares what your name is?

1253
01:22:05,741 --> 01:22:09,381
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1254
01:22:09,461 --> 01:22:13,182
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

1255
01:22:13,222 --> 01:22:16,023
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1256
01:22:16,062 --> 01:22:19,223
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

1257
01:22:21,064 --> 01:22:23,024
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1258
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,625
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

1259
01:22:25,664 --> 01:22:27,985
my way or the highway.

1260
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:30,105
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1261
01:22:30,866 --> 01:22:33,827
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

1262
01:22:33,866 --> 01:22:36,547
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1263
01:22:36,626 --> 01:22:39,548
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

1264
01:22:39,628 --> 01:22:42,548
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

1265
01:22:44,188 --> 01:22:48,149
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

1266
01:22:49,549 --> 01:22:51,630
Let's go to work.

1267
01:22:51,710 --> 01:22:54,551
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1268
01:22:54,591 --> 01:22:58,191
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

1269
01:22:58,952 --> 01:23:01,112
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

1270
01:23:01,192 --> 01:23:04,672
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

1271
01:23:04,753 --> 01:23:06,993
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1272
01:23:07,073 --> 01:23:10,714
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

1273
01:23:10,754 --> 01:23:13,954
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.

1274
01:23:16,434 --> 01:23:18,395
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1275
01:23:18,515 --> 01:23:22,636
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

1276
01:23:22,716 --> 01:23:24,837
We're there
for those stones, period.

1277
01:23:24,916 --> 01:23:28,398
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1278
01:23:29,638 --> 01:23:32,598
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1279
01:23:33,799 --> 01:23:36,759
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1280
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:41,320
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

1281
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,321
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1282
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:48,161
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1283
01:23:48,241 --> 01:23:50,602
smash their nose with your gun.

1284
01:23:50,642 --> 01:23:53,163
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

1285
01:23:53,243 --> 01:23:56,163
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

1286
01:23:56,243 --> 01:23:59,164
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1287
01:24:00,324 --> 01:24:02,804
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

1288
01:24:02,845 --> 01:24:06,805
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1289
01:24:07,966 --> 01:24:10,646
If it's the manager,
that's different.

1290
01:24:10,727 --> 01:24:12,966
The managers know not
to fuck around...

1291
01:24:13,047 --> 01:24:15,367
so if he's giving you static...

1292
01:24:15,447 --> 01:24:19,649
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1293
01:24:19,688 --> 01:24:23,648
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

1294
01:24:23,689 --> 01:24:27,010
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1295
01:24:27,050 --> 01:24:30,010
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

1296
01:24:34,011 --> 01:24:35,972
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

1297
01:24:51,614 --> 01:24:52,534
Fuck.

1298
01:25:11,138 --> 01:25:12,819
Jesus.

1299
01:25:12,898 --> 01:25:15,099
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

1300
01:25:15,179 --> 01:25:17,580
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

1301
01:25:30,782 --> 01:25:32,103
Is he dead?

1302
01:25:33,502 --> 01:25:35,424
Did he die or not?

1303
01:25:36,623 --> 01:25:38,063
Let's go.

1304
01:26:12,711 --> 01:26:15,031
Hold it! Get out!

1305
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:18,632
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1306
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:36,315
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

1307
01:26:37,396 --> 01:26:39,316
I can't believe she killed me.

1308
01:26:39,396 --> 01:26:40,957
Who'd have fucking thought that?

1309
01:26:40,996 --> 01:26:43,678
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

1310
01:26:43,757 --> 01:26:46,678
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1311
01:26:46,758 --> 01:26:48,518
But you ain't dying.

1312
01:26:49,798 --> 01:26:52,719
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1313
01:26:53,999 --> 01:26:55,960
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

1314
01:27:31,047 --> 01:27:32,528
What the fuck happened?

1315
01:27:32,607 --> 01:27:36,568
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1316
01:27:37,848 --> 01:27:40,049
What? I didn't hear you.

1317
01:27:40,129 --> 01:27:41,569
I said...

1318
01:27:43,409 --> 01:27:44,970
Blonde went crazy.

1319
01:27:45,050 --> 01:27:50,331
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1320
01:27:50,411 --> 01:27:51,651
This cop?

1321
01:27:56,731 --> 01:27:58,812
He went crazy?
Something like that?

1322
01:27:58,893 --> 01:28:00,972
Worse or better?

1323
01:28:01,054 --> 01:28:04,254
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

1324
01:28:05,494 --> 01:28:07,494
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1325
01:28:07,614 --> 01:28:11,415
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

1326
01:28:12,095 --> 01:28:13,175
What'd I tell ya?

1327
01:28:13,256 --> 01:28:16,817
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1328
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:20,097
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

1329
01:28:20,177 --> 01:28:23,818
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1330
01:28:25,377 --> 01:28:27,139
I don't buy it.

1331
01:28:27,178 --> 01:28:28,619
Doesn't make sense.

1332
01:28:32,900 --> 01:28:35,380
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

1333
01:28:35,460 --> 01:28:39,021
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1334
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:41,261
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

1335
01:28:41,342 --> 01:28:45,502
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

1336
01:28:46,463 --> 01:28:48,423
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1337
01:28:48,462 --> 01:28:49,663
was gonna kill you...

1338
01:28:49,743 --> 01:28:52,943
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

1339
01:28:52,984 --> 01:28:54,944
take the diamonds and scram.

1340
01:28:54,984 --> 01:28:58,184
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?

1341
01:28:58,864 --> 01:29:00,825
I swear on my mother's soul...

1342
01:29:00,866 --> 01:29:02,506
that's what happened.

1343
01:29:03,505 --> 01:29:06,467
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

1344
01:29:06,546 --> 01:29:09,627
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1345
01:29:09,667 --> 01:29:12,307
He could've fuckin' walked.

1346
01:29:12,388 --> 01:29:16,548
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1347
01:29:16,628 --> 01:29:19,708
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

1348
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:22,070
He did four years for us.

1349
01:29:22,150 --> 01:29:24,550
So, Mr. Orange...

1350
01:29:24,629 --> 01:29:27,631
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

1351
01:29:27,710 --> 01:29:30,512
who did four years
for my father...

1352
01:29:30,632 --> 01:29:35,553
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

1353
01:29:35,592 --> 01:29:38,672
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

1354
01:29:38,713 --> 01:29:41,673
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

1355
01:29:41,714 --> 01:29:46,395
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

1356
01:29:46,474 --> 01:29:48,394
to rip us off?

1357
01:29:50,075 --> 01:29:53,435
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1358
01:29:53,516 --> 01:29:55,197
What the hell for?

1359
01:29:56,316 --> 01:29:58,237
It'd just be more bullshit.

1360
01:30:00,398 --> 01:30:02,357
This man set us up.

1361
01:30:03,598 --> 01:30:06,638
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

1362
01:30:06,719 --> 01:30:10,479
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

1363
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:14,241
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

1364
01:30:15,601 --> 01:30:18,922
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

1365
01:30:19,001 --> 01:30:20,402
what you're talking about.

1366
01:30:20,522 --> 01:30:24,042
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1367
01:30:24,122 --> 01:30:25,922
Like hell I am.

1368
01:30:25,962 --> 01:30:29,084
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1369
01:30:29,163 --> 01:30:30,884
He's a good kid.

1370
01:30:30,924 --> 01:30:33,524
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1371
01:30:33,604 --> 01:30:35,365
We're all real emotional.

1372
01:30:35,444 --> 01:30:39,645
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

1373
01:30:39,725 --> 01:30:41,286
You don't know jack shit!

1374
01:30:41,365 --> 01:30:42,526
I do.

1375
01:30:42,606 --> 01:30:44,526
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

1376
01:30:44,607 --> 01:30:46,727
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

1377
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:49,808
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

1378
01:30:49,887 --> 01:30:51,888
How do you know all this?

1379
01:30:51,968 --> 01:30:55,368
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

1380
01:30:55,448 --> 01:30:58,730
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1381
01:30:58,809 --> 01:31:02,570
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

1382
01:31:02,650 --> 01:31:04,970
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1383
01:31:07,331 --> 01:31:09,651
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1384
01:31:09,692 --> 01:31:12,532
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

1385
01:31:12,611 --> 01:31:15,533
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1386
01:31:15,612 --> 01:31:17,533
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1387
01:31:18,413 --> 01:31:20,293
Larry, look...

1388
01:31:20,334 --> 01:31:22,334
it's been quite a long time.

1389
01:31:22,374 --> 01:31:23,814
A lot of jobs.

1390
01:31:23,854 --> 01:31:26,935
There's no need for this, man.

1391
01:31:27,014 --> 01:31:29,415
Let's just put our guns down...

1392
01:31:30,575 --> 01:31:32,296
and let's settle this...

1393
01:31:32,336 --> 01:31:34,016
with a fucking conversation.

1394
01:31:34,097 --> 01:31:37,537
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

1395
01:31:37,657 --> 01:31:39,818
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

1396
01:31:39,897 --> 01:31:43,178
Larry, we have been friends.

1397
01:31:43,258 --> 01:31:45,458
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

1398
01:31:45,539 --> 01:31:47,459
but I'll put bullets
in you.

1399
01:31:47,539 --> 01:31:49,780
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

1400
01:31:50,580 --> 01:31:52,861
Goddamn you, Joe...

1401
01:31:52,940 --> 01:31:54,380
don't make me do this.

1402
01:31:54,461 --> 01:31:57,061
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

1403
01:33:43,922 --> 01:33:45,843
I'm sorry, kid.

1404
01:33:48,244 --> 01:33:50,164
Looks like we're gonna...

1405
01:33:51,524 --> 01:33:53,485
do a little time.

1406
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:01,887
I'm a cop.

1407
01:34:03,686 --> 01:34:05,647
Larry...

1408
01:34:06,887 --> 01:34:08,848
I'm sorry.

1409
01:34:10,048 --> 01:34:11,808
I'm...

1410
01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:14,009
so sorry.

1411
01:34:16,890 --> 01:34:19,329
I'm a cop.

1412
01:34:36,414 --> 01:34:37,853
I'm sorry.

1413
01:34:49,576 --> 01:34:51,056
I'm sorry.

1414
01:34:52,617 --> 01:34:54,297
I'm...

1415
01:34:54,377 --> 01:34:55,617
sorr--

1416
01:34:58,378 --> 01:34:59,459
Freeze!

1417
01:34:59,538 --> 01:35:01,538
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1418
01:35:01,578 --> 01:35:03,539
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1419
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:06,420
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1420
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,780
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
