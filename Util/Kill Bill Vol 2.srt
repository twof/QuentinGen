1
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:17,545
Do you find me sadistic?

2
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:21,550
You know, Kiddo,

3
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:24,052
I'd like to believe

4
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,555
you're aware enough, even now,

5
00:00:27,623 --> 00:00:31,727
to know that there's
nothing sadistic

6
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,864
in my actions.

7
00:00:34,932 --> 00:00:37,000
At this moment

8
00:00:38,536 --> 00:00:41,171
this is me

9
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,974
at my most masochistic.

10
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:46,776
Bill.. it's your ba..

11
00:00:53,018 --> 00:00:55,119
Looked dead, didn't I?

12
00:00:55,187 --> 00:00:56,855
Well, I wasn't.

13
00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:00,526
But it wasn't from lack of
trying, I can tell you that.

14
00:01:00,593 --> 00:01:03,762
Actually, Bill's last bullet
put me in a coma -

15
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,767
a coma I was to lie in
for four years.

16
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,136
When I woke up, I went on

17
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:12,205
what the movie advertisements
refer to as

18
00:01:12,273 --> 00:01:15,809
"a roaring rampage
of revenge."

19
00:01:15,877 --> 00:01:18,912
I roared and I rampaged,

20
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,616
and I got bloody satisfaction.

21
00:01:22,684 --> 00:01:26,454
I've killed a hell of a lot of
people to get to this point,

22
00:01:26,522 --> 00:01:29,791
but I have only one more.

23
00:01:29,859 --> 00:01:31,994
The last one.

24
00:01:32,062 --> 00:01:35,531
The one I'm driving to
right now.

25
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:38,435
The only one left.

26
00:01:38,502 --> 00:01:42,172
And when I arrive
at my destination,

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,543
I am gonna kill Bill.

28
00:01:45,568 --> 00:01:56,568
<font color=#FFFF00>Kill Bill Vol 2</font>
<font color=#00FFFF>Blu-ray</font>

30
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:12,539
Now, the incident
that happened

31
00:02:12,607 --> 00:02:14,341
at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel

32
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:17,545
that put this whole gory
story into motion

33
00:02:17,612 --> 00:02:20,248
has since become legend.

34
00:02:20,315 --> 00:02:23,084
"Massacre at Two Pines."

35
00:02:23,151 --> 00:02:25,086
That's what the newspapers
called it.

36
00:02:25,153 --> 00:02:26,787
The local TV news called it

37
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:31,058
"The El Paso, Texas,
Wedding Chapel Massacre."

38
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:33,827
How it happened,
who was there,

39
00:02:33,895 --> 00:02:36,897
how many got killed
and who killed them

40
00:02:36,965 --> 00:02:40,467
changes depending on
who's telling the story.

41
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,202
In actual fact,

42
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:45,873
the massacre didn't happen
during a wedding at all.

43
00:02:45,941 --> 00:02:48,876
It was a wedding rehearsal.

44
00:02:48,944 --> 00:02:50,911
Now, when we come
to the part where I say,

45
00:02:50,979 --> 00:02:54,749
"You may kiss the bride,"
you may kiss the bride,

46
00:02:54,816 --> 00:02:57,851
but don't stick your tongue
in her mouth.

47
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:02,122
This might be funny
to your friends,

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,393
but it would be embarrassing
to your parents.

49
00:03:06,862 --> 00:03:11,232
We'll try to restrain
ourselves, Reverend.

50
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,267
Y'all got a song?

51
00:03:16,472 --> 00:03:20,142
How 'bout "Love Me Tender"?
I can play that.

52
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,077
Sure.
Yeah.

53
00:03:22,145 --> 00:03:24,646
"Love Me Tender" 'd be great.

54
00:03:24,714 --> 00:03:27,750
Rufus - he's the man.

55
00:03:27,818 --> 00:03:30,887
Rufus, who was that
that you used to play for?

56
00:03:30,955 --> 00:03:32,956
Rufus Thomas.

57
00:03:33,024 --> 00:03:35,926
Rufus Thomas.
Rufus Thomas.

58
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,862
I was a Drell.
I was a Drifter.

59
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:40,330
I was a Coaster.

60
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:44,101
I was part of the Gang.
I was a Bar-Kay.

61
00:03:44,168 --> 00:03:48,239
If they come through Texas,
I played with 'em.

62
00:03:48,306 --> 00:03:52,009
Rufus - he's the man.

63
00:03:54,713 --> 00:03:57,147
Have I forgotten anything?
Um..

64
00:03:57,215 --> 00:04:00,684
Oh, yes. You forgot, uh,
the seating arrangements.

65
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:03,420
Thank you, Mother.
Yes.

66
00:04:03,488 --> 00:04:05,789
Now, the way we
normally do this,

67
00:04:05,857 --> 00:04:08,059
we have the bride's side,

68
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:10,161
and then we have
the groom's side.

69
00:04:10,228 --> 00:04:13,330
But since the bride
ain't got nobody comin',

70
00:04:13,398 --> 00:04:17,367
and the groom's got
far too many people comin'..

71
00:04:17,435 --> 00:04:20,337
Well, yeah, they're comin'
all the way from Oklahoma.

72
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:26,544
Right.. Well, I don't
see no problem with..

73
00:04:26,611 --> 00:04:29,847
the groom's side sharing
the bride's side.

74
00:04:29,915 --> 00:04:32,784
Do you, Mother?
I don't have
a problem with that.

75
00:04:32,851 --> 00:04:34,819
But, uh..

76
00:04:34,886 --> 00:04:38,690
Honey, you know, it would be
good if you had somebody come.

77
00:04:38,758 --> 00:04:41,159
You know, as a sign
of good faith?

78
00:04:42,662 --> 00:04:45,297
Well, I don't have anybody,

79
00:04:45,364 --> 00:04:49,301
except for Tommy
and my friends.

80
00:04:49,369 --> 00:04:50,936
You have no family?

81
00:04:51,004 --> 00:04:53,973
Well, I'm workin'
on changing that.

82
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,741
Mrs. Harmony,
we're all the family

83
00:04:55,809 --> 00:04:59,579
this little angel's
ever gonna need.

84
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:01,381
I'm not feeling very well,

85
00:05:01,449 --> 00:05:04,083
and this bitch is starting
to piss me off.

86
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,718
So while y'all blather on,

87
00:05:05,786 --> 00:05:07,454
I'm gonna go outside
and get some air.
OK.

88
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:10,690
Um, uh, Reverend,
sorry, uh..

89
00:05:10,758 --> 00:05:12,191
She's gonna go out
and get some air.

90
00:05:12,259 --> 00:05:14,393
Yeah. Given her delicate
condition.

91
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:17,063
She just needs a few minutes
to get it together.
She'll be OK.

92
00:05:17,130 --> 00:05:19,598
Right.

93
00:06:36,579 --> 00:06:38,013
Hello, Kiddo.

94
00:06:43,253 --> 00:06:46,121
How did you find me?

95
00:06:46,188 --> 00:06:47,889
I'm the man.

96
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:54,763
What are you doin' here?

97
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:56,732
What am I doin'?

98
00:06:58,502 --> 00:07:00,369
Well,

99
00:07:00,437 --> 00:07:03,673
a moment ago
I was playing my flute.

100
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:13,250
At this moment

101
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,319
I'm lookin' at the most
beautiful bride

102
00:07:15,387 --> 00:07:17,722
these old eyes have ever seen.

103
00:07:19,658 --> 00:07:23,161
Why are you here?
Last look.

104
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,264
Are you gonna be nice?

105
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:31,569
I've never been nice
my whole life.

106
00:07:31,636 --> 00:07:34,872
But I'll do my best
to be sweet.

107
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,141
Hmm.

108
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:39,677
I always told you,

109
00:07:39,744 --> 00:07:42,813
your sweet side
is your best side.

110
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:47,217
I guess that's why you're
the only one who's ever seen it.

111
00:07:49,621 --> 00:07:51,988
I see you got a bun
in the oven.

112
00:07:52,056 --> 00:07:56,994
Hmm. I'm knocked up.

113
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:01,465
Jeez, Louise.
That young man of yours

114
00:08:01,532 --> 00:08:05,669
sure doesn't believe
in wasting time, does he?

115
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:08,271
Have you seen Tommy?

116
00:08:10,274 --> 00:08:13,611
Big guy in the tux?
Yes.

117
00:08:13,678 --> 00:08:16,948
Then I saw him.

118
00:08:17,016 --> 00:08:20,418
I like his hair.

119
00:08:20,486 --> 00:08:24,856
You promised you'd be nice.

120
00:08:24,924 --> 00:08:29,427
No, I said I'd do my best.
That's hardly a promise.

121
00:08:29,495 --> 00:08:31,729
But you're right.

122
00:08:31,797 --> 00:08:36,633
What does your young man do
for a living?

123
00:08:36,701 --> 00:08:39,636
He owns a used-record store
here in El Paso.

124
00:08:39,704 --> 00:08:42,439
Ah. Music lover, eh?

125
00:08:42,507 --> 00:08:45,575
He's fond of music.

126
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:47,410
Aren't we all?

127
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,417
And what are you doing
for a J-O-B these days?

128
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:59,855
I work in the record store.

129
00:08:59,922 --> 00:09:01,924
Aso.

130
00:09:03,493 --> 00:09:06,862
It all suddenly seems so clear.

131
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:14,470
Do you like it?
Yeah. I like it
a lot, smartass.

132
00:09:14,538 --> 00:09:18,675
I get to listen to music all
day, talk about music all day.

133
00:09:18,743 --> 00:09:21,912
It's really cool.

134
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,413
It's gonna be a great
environment

135
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:25,449
for my little girl
to grow up in.

136
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:33,289
As opposed to jetting
around the world,
killing human beings

137
00:09:33,357 --> 00:09:35,925
and being paid
vast sums of money?

138
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:39,561
Precisely.

139
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:42,597
Well, my old friend,

140
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:45,034
to each his own.

141
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:48,904
However,
all cockblockery aside,

142
00:09:48,972 --> 00:09:53,175
I am looking forward
to meeting your young man.

143
00:09:53,242 --> 00:09:58,513
I happen to be, more or less,
particular whom my gal marries.

144
00:10:01,049 --> 00:10:02,984
You want to come
to the wedding?

145
00:10:03,051 --> 00:10:04,819
Only if I can sit
on the bride's side.

146
00:10:06,422 --> 00:10:08,990
You'll find it a bit lonely
on my side.

147
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:12,494
Your side always
was a bit lonely.

148
00:10:12,561 --> 00:10:15,863
But I wouldn't sit
anywhere else.

149
00:10:17,867 --> 00:10:20,068
You know,

150
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:22,604
I had the loveliest dream
about you..

151
00:10:22,671 --> 00:10:25,073
Oh, here's Tommy!
Call me Arlene.

152
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,542
You must be Tommy!
Uh-huh.

153
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:30,011
Arlene's told me
so much about you.

154
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,847
Honey, you OK?
Oh, I'm fine.

155
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:35,683
Tommy, I'd like you
to meet my father.

156
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:38,686
Oh, my God!

157
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,655
Oh, my God, this is great!

158
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:43,458
I'm so glad to meet you,
sir.. oh, Dad.

159
00:10:43,526 --> 00:10:45,827
The name's Bill.

160
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:48,296
Well, it's great
to meet you.. Bill.

161
00:10:48,364 --> 00:10:49,731
Arlene told me
you couldn't make it.

162
00:10:49,798 --> 00:10:53,001
Surprise.
That's my pop for ya.

163
00:10:53,068 --> 00:10:54,935
Always full of surprises.

164
00:10:55,003 --> 00:10:58,439
Well,
in the surprise department,

165
00:10:58,507 --> 00:11:01,876
the apple doesn't fall
far from the tree.

166
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:04,078
When did you get in?
Just now.

167
00:11:04,146 --> 00:11:07,314
Did you come straight
from Australia?
Of course.

168
00:11:07,382 --> 00:11:10,217
Daddy, I told Tommy that you
were in Perth mining for silver,

169
00:11:10,285 --> 00:11:13,386
and no one could reach you.

170
00:11:13,454 --> 00:11:16,656
Lucky for us all,
that's not the case.

171
00:11:16,724 --> 00:11:20,459
So.. What's this all about?

172
00:11:20,527 --> 00:11:22,761
I've heard of
wedding rehearsals,

173
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:24,664
but I don't believe
I've ever heard of

174
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,966
a wedding dress rehearsal
before.

175
00:11:27,034 --> 00:11:29,702
We thought, "Why pay
so much money for a dress"

176
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:31,570
you're only gonna wear once?"

177
00:11:31,638 --> 00:11:34,740
Especially when Arlene looks
so goddamn beautiful in it.

178
00:11:34,808 --> 00:11:39,846
So I think we're gonna try
to get all the mileage
we can out of it.

179
00:11:39,914 --> 00:11:42,182
Isn't it supposed to be
bad luck for the groom

180
00:11:42,249 --> 00:11:44,785
to see the bride
in her wedding dress

181
00:11:44,853 --> 00:11:46,220
before the ceremony?

182
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:48,021
Well..

183
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,657
I guess I just believe
in living dangerously.

184
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:54,695
I know just what you mean.

185
00:11:54,763 --> 00:11:57,898
Son.
Some of us have places to be.

186
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,666
Sure do.

187
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:02,168
Look, we gotta go through this
one more time,

188
00:12:02,235 --> 00:12:04,170
so why don't you have a s..

189
00:12:04,238 --> 00:12:06,172
Oh, my God.

190
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:08,374
What am I thinking?
You should give her away!

191
00:12:08,442 --> 00:12:12,010
Tommy, that's not exactly
Daddy's cup of tea.

192
00:12:12,078 --> 00:12:14,580
I think Father would
be much more comfortable

193
00:12:14,648 --> 00:12:16,248
sitting with the rest
of the guests.

194
00:12:16,316 --> 00:12:17,449
Hmm. Really?

195
00:12:17,517 --> 00:12:19,652
That's asking a lot.

196
00:12:21,254 --> 00:12:23,956
Oh. OK. Well, forget it.

197
00:12:24,024 --> 00:12:26,793
But how about we go
out to dinner tonight
to celebrate?

198
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:29,596
Only on the condition
that I pay for everything.

199
00:12:29,663 --> 00:12:32,265
Deal. We got to do this now.

200
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:36,437
Can I watch?
Absolutely. Have a seat.

201
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:39,974
Which is the bride's side?
Right over here.

202
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,179
Mother, here we go!

203
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:49,451
Now, son, about them vows..

204
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:59,327
Bill.. I just want..

205
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:03,365
You don't owe me a damn thing.

206
00:13:03,432 --> 00:13:05,867
If he's the man you want,

207
00:13:05,935 --> 00:13:09,070
then go stand by him.

208
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:36,300
Do I look pretty?
Oh, yes.

209
00:13:47,144 --> 00:13:49,112
Thank you.

210
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,547
What the hell?

211
00:14:27,017 --> 00:14:28,984
No! Bill!

212
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:11,826
You tellin' me she cut her way
through 88 bodyguards

213
00:15:11,894 --> 00:15:14,329
'fore she got to O-Ren?

214
00:15:14,397 --> 00:15:16,665
Nah, there wasn't
really 88 of 'em.

215
00:15:16,733 --> 00:15:19,302
They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88."

216
00:15:19,369 --> 00:15:21,537
How come?
I don't know.

217
00:15:21,605 --> 00:15:24,673
I guess they thought
it sounded cool.

218
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:28,477
Anyhow, they all fell
under her Hanzo sword.

219
00:15:28,545 --> 00:15:30,479
She got a Hanzo sword?

220
00:15:30,547 --> 00:15:32,581
He made one for her.

221
00:15:32,649 --> 00:15:36,085
Didn't he swear a blood oath
to never make another sword?

222
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:39,689
It would appear
he has broken it.

223
00:15:42,092 --> 00:15:45,228
Them Japs sure know how
to hold a grudge, don't they?

224
00:15:48,165 --> 00:15:52,735
Or maybe.. you just tend
to bring that out in people.

225
00:15:52,803 --> 00:15:58,108
I know this is a ridiculous
question before I ask it,

226
00:15:58,175 --> 00:16:02,612
but you haven't, by any chance,
kept up with your.. swordplay?

227
00:16:05,216 --> 00:16:07,317
I, um..

228
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:10,888
I pawned that
years ago.

229
00:16:10,955 --> 00:16:15,292
You hocked a Hattori Hanzo
sword?

230
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,460
Yep.

231
00:16:16,527 --> 00:16:19,729
It was priceless.

232
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:26,102
Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.

233
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:30,539
In El Paso,
I got me $250 for it.

234
00:16:32,341 --> 00:16:35,877
I'm a bouncer
in a titty bar, Bill.

235
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,214
If she wants to fight with me,
all she's gotta do is

236
00:16:40,282 --> 00:16:42,350
come down to the club
and start some shit,

237
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,720
and we'll be in a fight.

238
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:50,591
I know we haven't spoken
in some time,

239
00:16:50,659 --> 00:16:54,529
and the last time we spoke
wasn't the most pleasant,

240
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:58,967
but you've got to get over
being mad at me

241
00:16:59,035 --> 00:17:01,302
and start becoming
afraid of

242
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:06,141
because she is coming,
and she's coming to kill you.

243
00:17:06,209 --> 00:17:07,810
And, unless you accept
my assistance,

244
00:17:07,877 --> 00:17:10,446
I have no doubt
she will succeed.

245
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:21,423
I don't dodge guilt

246
00:17:21,491 --> 00:17:24,293
and I don't jew out of
paying my comeuppance.

247
00:17:26,596 --> 00:17:29,932
Can't we just..
forget the past?

248
00:17:32,802 --> 00:17:34,804
That woman

249
00:17:34,871 --> 00:17:37,273
deserves her revenge.

250
00:17:41,946 --> 00:17:46,916
And we deserve to die.

251
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:53,823
But, then again,

252
00:17:53,891 --> 00:17:56,059
so does she.

253
00:17:59,397 --> 00:18:02,131
So I guess

254
00:18:02,199 --> 00:18:05,501
we'll just see.

255
00:18:05,569 --> 00:18:07,570
Won't we?

256
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,944
Late again.

257
00:18:46,012 --> 00:18:49,247
Budd, can't you tell time?

258
00:18:49,315 --> 00:18:51,116
There ain't nobody in here, man.

259
00:18:51,184 --> 00:18:53,518
Is that Budd?
Yeah.

260
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:56,588
Tell him to get
his fucking ass back here!

261
00:18:56,656 --> 00:18:58,557
OK.

262
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:02,894
Budd, Larry'd like a word
with ya.

263
00:19:06,599 --> 00:19:09,434
Take a hit. Be somebody, baby.

264
00:19:18,276 --> 00:19:20,410
You looking for me?

265
00:19:26,952 --> 00:19:30,554
I don't know what car wash
you worked before you came here

266
00:19:30,622 --> 00:19:32,857
that let you stroll in
20 minutes late,

267
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:35,592
but it wasn't owned by me
and I own a fuckin' car wash.

268
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,661
Do you want me to leave?
No, I don't want you
to leave.

269
00:19:37,729 --> 00:19:40,130
I want you to sit and wait.

270
00:19:40,198 --> 00:19:42,232
Larry,

271
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:45,202
there ain't nobody
out there, so..

272
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:50,908
"There's nobody
out there, Larry."

273
00:19:50,976 --> 00:19:54,712
What's your point?
That you're not needed here?

274
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:59,550
My point is I'm the bouncer,

275
00:19:59,618 --> 00:20:02,420
and there ain't nobody
out there to bounce.

276
00:20:02,488 --> 00:20:05,790
You saying that the reason

277
00:20:05,858 --> 00:20:10,929
that you're not doing the job
that I'm paying you to do

278
00:20:10,997 --> 00:20:14,199
is that you don't
have a job to do?

279
00:20:16,502 --> 00:20:18,770
No..
Is that what you're saying?

280
00:20:18,838 --> 00:20:20,872
What are you trying
to convince me of, exactly?

281
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:24,809
That you're as useless
as an asshole right here?

282
00:20:24,877 --> 00:20:27,212
Well, guess what, buddy.

283
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:32,518
I think you just fucking
convinced me.

284
00:20:32,586 --> 00:20:34,787
Let's go to the calendar.

285
00:20:34,855 --> 00:20:37,057
It's calendar time.

286
00:20:37,124 --> 00:20:39,626
Calendar time for Buddy.

287
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:43,062
OK. You working tomorrow?
Yeah.

288
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,197
Mm. No, you're n..

289
00:20:45,265 --> 00:20:47,233
You don't even know
what fucking day you work.

290
00:20:47,301 --> 00:20:49,335
Here. You're not working
tomorrow.

291
00:20:49,402 --> 00:20:52,370
You're working Wednesday.
Here you are. There you go.

292
00:20:52,438 --> 00:20:54,806
Workin' Thursday?
Yeah.

293
00:20:54,874 --> 00:20:58,943
I don't think so. Friday?

294
00:20:59,011 --> 00:21:01,312
I d.. There's your name.

295
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,348
If you say so.
There used to be
your name. OK?

296
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,384
Saturday.
There used to be your name.
Oh.

297
00:21:07,452 --> 00:21:10,988
Uh, Monday..
Here, how about that?

298
00:21:11,055 --> 00:21:12,823
Fuckin' with your cash
is the only thing

299
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:17,160
you kids seem to understand. OK?

300
00:21:17,228 --> 00:21:19,429
Now, I want you to go home
till I call you.

301
00:21:19,497 --> 00:21:21,898
Till I call you.

302
00:21:21,966 --> 00:21:23,600
Before you leave,
talk to Rocket.

303
00:21:23,668 --> 00:21:27,370
She's got a job for you to do.

304
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:30,306
And..

305
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:33,176
the hat.

306
00:21:33,243 --> 00:21:36,112
That fuckin' hat.

307
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:38,981
That fucking hat.

308
00:21:39,048 --> 00:21:41,983
How many times have I told you,

309
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:45,988
don't wear that fucking hat
here? How many?

310
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,127
Customers wear hats.

311
00:21:52,195 --> 00:21:54,829
Well, I'm not the boss
of the customers.

312
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,332
I'm the boss of you.

313
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,301
And I'm telling you
that I want you

314
00:21:59,368 --> 00:22:03,305
to keep that shit-kicker hat
at home.

315
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:41,510
Yeah, Budd, honey, uh,
the toilet is at it again.

316
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:44,580
There's shitty water
all over the floor.

317
00:22:44,647 --> 00:22:48,116
OK.. Rocket.

318
00:22:50,186 --> 00:22:53,155
I'll clean it up.
Mm-hmm.

319
00:26:31,043 --> 00:26:32,777
Now,

320
00:26:32,845 --> 00:26:35,447
that gentled you down some,
didn't it?

321
00:26:45,125 --> 00:26:48,127
Yep.

322
00:26:48,194 --> 00:26:49,795
Ain't nobody a badass

323
00:26:49,863 --> 00:26:54,033
with a double dose of rock salt
dug deep in her tits.

324
00:26:58,472 --> 00:27:01,940
Not havin'.. tits

325
00:27:06,513 --> 00:27:09,080
as fine

326
00:27:09,148 --> 00:27:11,883
or as big as yours,

327
00:27:11,951 --> 00:27:15,954
I can't even imagine
how bad that shit must sting.

328
00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:22,093
Yet..

329
00:27:25,931 --> 00:27:27,966
I don't want to, neither.

330
00:27:50,091 --> 00:27:51,491
I win.

331
00:29:03,931 --> 00:29:06,199
Bill.

332
00:29:06,266 --> 00:29:08,601
Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.

333
00:29:08,669 --> 00:29:11,471
Budd.
Bingo.

334
00:29:13,173 --> 00:29:15,508
And to what do I owe
this dubious pleasure?

335
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:20,780
I just caught me the cowgirl
that ain't never been caught.

336
00:29:22,216 --> 00:29:26,019
Did you kill her?
Well, not yet, I ain't.

337
00:29:26,087 --> 00:29:29,222
I shot her full of rock salt.

338
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,191
She's so gentle right now,

339
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,962
I could perform her
coup de grâce with a rock.

340
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:36,764
Anywho..

341
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:43,570
Guess what I'm holdin'
in my hand right now.

342
00:29:43,638 --> 00:29:44,872
What?

343
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:48,842
A brand-spankin'-new
Hattori Hanzo sword.

344
00:29:50,378 --> 00:29:55,549
And I'm here to tell ya, Elle,
that's what I call sharp.

345
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:57,518
How much?

346
00:29:57,586 --> 00:30:00,621
Oh, that's hard to say,
bein' that it's..

347
00:30:00,689 --> 00:30:01,989
priceless an' all.

348
00:30:02,057 --> 00:30:04,792
What's the terms?

349
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,929
You get your bony ass down here
first thing in the morning

350
00:30:08,997 --> 00:30:13,200
with a million dollars
in folding cash,

351
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:18,539
and I'll give you the greatest
sword ever made by a man.

352
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:24,444
Now, how do you like
the sound of that?

353
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,480
Sounds like we got a deal.
One condition.

354
00:30:27,548 --> 00:30:29,315
What?

355
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:32,985
She must suffer
to her last breath.

356
00:30:33,053 --> 00:30:35,721
Well..

357
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:38,657
That, Elle darlin',

358
00:30:38,725 --> 00:30:41,527
I can pretty much
damn well guarantee.

359
00:30:41,595 --> 00:30:46,399
Then I'll see you
in the mornin', millionaire.

360
00:30:46,467 --> 00:30:48,468
All right.

361
00:31:49,498 --> 00:31:53,167
Wakey-wakey. Eggs and bakey.

362
00:31:56,972 --> 00:31:58,939
Agh!

363
00:32:28,671 --> 00:32:30,972
I'm done!

364
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,575
Get me outta this hole!

365
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:38,647
Good.

366
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:49,859
Whew.

367
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:12,847
Whoa, look at those eyes.

368
00:33:12,915 --> 00:33:16,350
This bitch is furious.

369
00:33:16,418 --> 00:33:19,987
What did I tell ya?

370
00:33:20,055 --> 00:33:23,223
Is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

371
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:27,494
Or.. is she the cutest little
blond pussy you ever saw?

372
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:29,162
I seen better.

373
00:33:34,736 --> 00:33:36,336
You got anything to say?

374
00:33:39,007 --> 00:33:42,243
White women call this
"the silent treatment."

375
00:33:42,310 --> 00:33:45,446
And we let 'em think
we don't like it.

376
00:33:50,452 --> 00:33:52,720
You grab the feet,
I'll get the head.

377
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:04,197
Hey. Hey. Hey!

378
00:34:04,265 --> 00:34:06,767
Wiggle worm, you see this?

379
00:34:07,869 --> 00:34:09,603
You see it, don't ya?

380
00:34:12,473 --> 00:34:13,907
That's a can of Mace.

381
00:34:13,975 --> 00:34:16,877
Mm-hmm. No.

382
00:34:16,945 --> 00:34:20,381
You're goin' underneath
the ground tonight.

383
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:24,252
And.. that's all
there is to it.

384
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:29,625
I wanna bury ya.

385
00:34:32,295 --> 00:34:34,497
I was gonna bury ya..

386
00:34:40,670 --> 00:34:42,138
with this.

387
00:34:45,342 --> 00:34:48,545
But if you're gonna act
like a horse's ass,

388
00:34:51,048 --> 00:34:55,319
I'm gonna spray
this whole goddamn can

389
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,521
right in your eyeballs!

390
00:34:57,589 --> 00:35:00,558
I'll burn 'em right
outta your fuckin' head.

391
00:35:00,626 --> 00:35:04,028
Then you're gonna be blind

392
00:35:04,095 --> 00:35:05,196
and burnin'

393
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,468
and buried alive.

394
00:35:16,208 --> 00:35:18,142
Now, what's it gonna be, sister?

395
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:32,023
That's a wise decision.

396
00:35:44,503 --> 00:35:47,505
This is for breakin'
my brother's heart.

397
00:39:36,635 --> 00:39:39,237
Once upon a time

398
00:39:39,304 --> 00:39:42,139
in China,

399
00:39:42,207 --> 00:39:49,647
some believe around the year
one, double aught, three,

400
00:39:49,714 --> 00:39:52,850
head priest of
the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei,

401
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:57,121
was walking down a road

402
00:39:57,189 --> 00:39:59,323
contemplating whatever it is

403
00:39:59,391 --> 00:40:05,463
that a man of Pai Mei's
infinite powers
would contemplate -

404
00:40:05,531 --> 00:40:09,869
which is another way
of saying "Who knows?" -

405
00:40:09,936 --> 00:40:13,205
when a Shaolin monk
appeared on the road,

406
00:40:13,273 --> 00:40:15,774
traveling in the opposite
direction.

407
00:40:15,842 --> 00:40:20,280
As the monk and the priest
crossed paths,

408
00:40:20,347 --> 00:40:22,482
Pai Mei,

409
00:40:22,549 --> 00:40:28,020
in a practically unfathomable
display of generosity,

410
00:40:28,088 --> 00:40:33,124
gave the monk
the slightest of nods.

411
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,226
The nod

412
00:40:35,294 --> 00:40:37,528
was not returned.

413
00:40:40,832 --> 00:40:44,134
Now, was it the intention
of the Shaolin monk

414
00:40:44,202 --> 00:40:47,104
to insult Pai Mei?

415
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:52,175
Or did he just fail to see
the generous social gesture?

416
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:57,214
The motives of the monk
remain unknown.

417
00:40:57,282 --> 00:40:59,383
What is known

418
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,185
were the consequences.

419
00:41:13,698 --> 00:41:16,033
The next morning,

420
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:20,404
Pai Mei appeared
at the Shaolin temple

421
00:41:20,472 --> 00:41:23,674
and demanded
of the temple's head abbot

422
00:41:23,742 --> 00:41:30,448
that he offer Pai Mei his neck
to repay the insult.

423
00:41:30,516 --> 00:41:34,886
The abbot, at first,
tried to console Pai Mei,

424
00:41:34,954 --> 00:41:38,857
only to find Pai Mei was

425
00:41:38,925 --> 00:41:40,626
inconsolable.

426
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:54,371
So began

427
00:41:54,439 --> 00:41:56,974
the Massacre
of the Shaolin Temple

428
00:41:57,041 --> 00:42:00,243
and all sixty
of the monks inside,

429
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:03,846
at the fists of the White Lotus.

430
00:42:03,914 --> 00:42:07,817
And so began the legend

431
00:42:07,885 --> 00:42:12,188
of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

432
00:42:12,256 --> 00:42:13,456
And what, pray tell,

433
00:42:13,524 --> 00:42:16,159
is the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

434
00:42:16,226 --> 00:42:22,031
Quite simply, the deadliest blow
in all of martial arts.

435
00:42:23,768 --> 00:42:27,304
He hits you with his fingertips

436
00:42:27,371 --> 00:42:31,308
at five different pressure
points on your body,

437
00:42:31,376 --> 00:42:35,512
and then lets you walk away.

438
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,448
But once you've taken five steps

439
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:42,552
your heart explodes
inside your body

440
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:46,790
and you fall to the floor, dead.

441
00:42:46,857 --> 00:42:50,861
Did he teach you that?
No.

442
00:42:50,928 --> 00:42:55,967
He teaches no one
the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique.

443
00:42:56,034 --> 00:42:58,403
Now,

444
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:03,174
one of the things I've always
liked about you, Kiddo,

445
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,646
is you appear wise
beyond your years.

446
00:43:11,950 --> 00:43:16,587
So, allow me to impart
a word to the wise.

447
00:43:16,655 --> 00:43:18,289
Whatever..

448
00:43:18,357 --> 00:43:22,327
Whatever Pai Mei says, obey.

449
00:43:23,729 --> 00:43:27,432
If you flash him, even for
an instant, a defiant eye,

450
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,834
he'll pluck it out.

451
00:43:29,902 --> 00:43:34,205
And if you throw
any American sass his way,

452
00:43:34,273 --> 00:43:38,443
he'll snap your back and your
neck like they were twigs.

453
00:43:40,846 --> 00:43:43,781
And that will be
the story of you.

454
00:44:04,067 --> 00:44:06,635
He'll accept you as his student.

455
00:44:06,703 --> 00:44:08,704
What happened to you?
Nothin'.

456
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,940
Get in a fight?
Friendly contest.

457
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:13,542
Why did he accept me?

458
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,779
Because he's a very,
very, very old man.

459
00:44:17,847 --> 00:44:21,083
And, like all rotten bastards,

460
00:44:21,151 --> 00:44:26,321
when they become old,
they get lonely.

461
00:44:26,389 --> 00:44:29,358
Which has no effect
on their dispositions,

462
00:44:29,425 --> 00:44:34,129
but it does teach them
the value of company.

463
00:44:34,197 --> 00:44:36,765
Whew. Oh.

464
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:42,304
Just seein' those
steps again makes me ache.

465
00:44:42,372 --> 00:44:45,340
You're gonna have a lot of fun
carrying buckets of water

466
00:44:45,408 --> 00:44:47,842
up and down that fucker.

467
00:44:52,148 --> 00:44:54,282
When will I see you again?

468
00:44:54,350 --> 00:44:57,886
That's the title of my favorite
soul song of the 70s.

469
00:44:57,954 --> 00:44:59,654
What?
Nothin'.

470
00:44:59,722 --> 00:45:03,191
When he tells me you're done.

471
00:45:03,259 --> 00:45:04,926
When do you think
that might be?

472
00:45:04,994 --> 00:45:07,929
That, my dearest,
depends entirely on you.

473
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,666
Now remember,
no sarcasm, no back talk.

474
00:45:11,734 --> 00:45:14,102
At least not
for the first year or so.

475
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,272
You're gonna have to
let him warm up to you.

476
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:21,208
He hates Caucasians,
despises Americans,

477
00:45:21,276 --> 00:45:24,078
and has nothing
but contempt for women.

478
00:45:26,448 --> 00:45:30,852
So in your case..
it might take a little while.

479
00:45:30,919 --> 00:45:32,286
Adiós.

480
00:47:41,151 --> 00:47:42,351
A little.

481
00:48:15,355 --> 00:48:18,623
I am proficient
in Tiger-Crane Style,

482
00:48:18,691 --> 00:48:20,125
and I am more than proficient

483
00:48:20,192 --> 00:48:22,761
in the exquisite art
of the Samurai sword.

484
00:52:05,184 --> 00:52:07,352
Argh!

485
00:52:09,288 --> 00:52:10,922
Argh!

486
00:52:25,338 --> 00:52:26,605
No, please don't!

487
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:35,480
Aaargh!

488
00:53:06,212 --> 00:53:08,280
Yes!

489
01:00:02,503 --> 01:00:06,205
Come on, you bitch.

490
01:00:47,146 --> 01:00:49,815
OK, Pai Mei.

491
01:00:51,985 --> 01:00:54,053
Here I come.

492
01:03:02,945 --> 01:03:06,047
May I have a glass
of water, please?

493
01:05:44,209 --> 01:05:47,644
So that's a Texas funeral?
Yep.

494
01:05:49,247 --> 01:05:51,582
I have to give it to ya, Budd.

495
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:54,852
That's a pretty
fucked-up way to die.

496
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:57,187
What's the name on the grave
she's buried under?

497
01:05:57,255 --> 01:05:59,489
Paula

498
01:06:01,425 --> 01:06:03,526
Schultz.

499
01:06:08,799 --> 01:06:10,733
Can I look at the sword?

500
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:13,835
That's my money right there
in that red bag, isn't it?

501
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,705
It sure is.

502
01:06:16,773 --> 01:06:19,675
Well, then,
it's your sword now.

503
01:06:37,959 --> 01:06:40,259
What's that you said?

504
01:06:40,327 --> 01:06:42,461
So this is
a Hattori Hanzo sword.

505
01:06:42,529 --> 01:06:45,131
That's a Hanzo sword,
all right.

506
01:06:45,199 --> 01:06:49,535
Bill tells me you once had
one of these of your own.

507
01:06:49,603 --> 01:06:51,638
Yeah, once.

508
01:06:51,706 --> 01:06:54,207
Yeah? How does this one
compare to that?

509
01:07:03,585 --> 01:07:08,589
If you're gonna compare
a Hanzo sword,

510
01:07:08,656 --> 01:07:12,525
you compare it to every
other sword ever made -

511
01:07:12,593 --> 01:07:16,496
wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.

512
01:07:24,871 --> 01:07:28,541
Here you go.
Wrap your lips around that.

513
01:07:37,784 --> 01:07:40,319
So,

514
01:07:40,387 --> 01:07:43,589
which "R" are you filled with?

515
01:07:43,657 --> 01:07:45,524
What?

516
01:07:48,295 --> 01:07:50,330
They say

517
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:54,702
the number-one killer
of old people

518
01:07:54,769 --> 01:07:58,038
is retirement.

519
01:07:58,106 --> 01:08:00,107
People got a job to do,

520
01:08:00,175 --> 01:08:04,278
they tend to live a little bit
longer so they can do it.

521
01:08:05,815 --> 01:08:08,083
I've always figured that

522
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:13,988
warriors and their enemies
share the same relationship.

523
01:08:14,056 --> 01:08:15,990
So now that you're
not gonna have to

524
01:08:16,058 --> 01:08:20,629
face your enemy no more
on the battlefield,

525
01:08:20,697 --> 01:08:24,066
which "R" ya filled with?

526
01:08:25,501 --> 01:08:27,568
Relief?

527
01:08:30,105 --> 01:08:33,473
Or regret?

528
01:08:33,541 --> 01:08:35,776
A little bit of both.

529
01:08:35,844 --> 01:08:39,146
Horseshit.

530
01:08:39,213 --> 01:08:42,015
I'm sure you do feel
a little bit of both.

531
01:08:42,083 --> 01:08:45,852
But I know damn well
that you feel one

532
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,622
more than you feel the other.

533
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:52,859
And the question was,
which one is it?

534
01:08:54,963 --> 01:08:57,898
Regret.

535
01:08:57,966 --> 01:09:00,401
You know, you gotta
hand it to the old girl.

536
01:09:00,468 --> 01:09:05,338
I never saw anybody buffalo Bill
the way she buffaloed Bill.

537
01:09:05,406 --> 01:09:07,474
Bill thought
she was so damn smart.

538
01:09:07,542 --> 01:09:09,876
And I tried to tell him

539
01:09:09,944 --> 01:09:12,212
she was just smart for a blonde.

540
01:09:31,399 --> 01:09:33,233
Thanks a bunch.

541
01:09:45,614 --> 01:09:47,514
All right.

542
01:09:50,385 --> 01:09:52,820
Argh! Argh!

543
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,782
Mmm.

544
01:10:19,849 --> 01:10:21,783
I'm sorry, Budd.

545
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:24,453
That was rude of me,
wasn't it?

546
01:10:24,521 --> 01:10:28,024
Budd, I'd like to introduce
my friend, the black mamba.

547
01:10:28,092 --> 01:10:31,127
Black mamba, this is Budd.

548
01:10:31,195 --> 01:10:33,763
You know, before I picked
that little fella up,

549
01:10:33,831 --> 01:10:35,966
I looked him up on the Internet.

550
01:10:36,034 --> 01:10:39,236
Fascinating creature,
the black mamba.

551
01:10:39,304 --> 01:10:41,906
Listen to this.

552
01:10:46,044 --> 01:10:48,379
"In Africa, the saying goes"

553
01:10:48,447 --> 01:10:50,982
'In the bush,
an elephant can kill you,

554
01:10:51,049 --> 01:10:52,583
a leopard can kill you,

555
01:10:52,651 --> 01:10:54,585
and a black mamba
can kill you.

556
01:10:54,653 --> 01:10:56,620
But only with the mamba,

557
01:10:56,688 --> 01:10:58,189
and this has been
true in Africa

558
01:10:58,256 --> 01:10:59,924
since the dawn of time,

559
01:10:59,991 --> 01:11:01,225
"is death sure.'"

560
01:11:01,293 --> 01:11:05,964
"Hence its handle,
'Death Incarnate.'"

561
01:11:06,031 --> 01:11:08,032
Pretty cool, huh?

562
01:11:09,602 --> 01:11:13,271
"Its neurotoxic venom is one of
nature's most effective poisons,

563
01:11:13,339 --> 01:11:16,675
acting on the nervous system,
causing paralysis."

564
01:11:16,742 --> 01:11:20,278
"The venom of a black mamba
can kill a human being
in four hours

565
01:11:20,346 --> 01:11:23,048
if, say, bitten on the ankle
or the thumb."

566
01:11:23,116 --> 01:11:26,551
"However, a bite
to the face or torso

567
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:29,821
can bring death from paralysis
within 20 minutes."

568
01:11:29,889 --> 01:11:33,591
Now, you should listen to this,
'cause this concerns you.

569
01:11:35,394 --> 01:11:38,229
"The amount of venom that can
be delivered from a single bite

570
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:41,565
can be gargantuan."

571
01:11:41,633 --> 01:11:44,135
You know, I've always liked
that word "gargantuan."

572
01:11:44,203 --> 01:11:48,106
I so rarely have an opportunity
to use it in a sentence.

573
01:11:48,174 --> 01:11:50,541
"If not treated quickly
with antivenom,

574
01:11:50,609 --> 01:11:53,445
ten to 15 milligrams
can be fatal to human beings."

575
01:11:53,512 --> 01:11:56,047
"However, the black mamba
can deliver"

576
01:11:56,115 --> 01:11:59,385
as much as 100 to 400
milligrams of venom

577
01:11:59,452 --> 01:12:01,987
"from a single bite."

578
01:12:04,124 --> 01:12:06,692
Now,

579
01:12:06,760 --> 01:12:11,697
in these last agonizing
minutes of life you have left,

580
01:12:11,765 --> 01:12:14,733
let me answer that question
you asked earlier
more thoroughly.

581
01:12:18,038 --> 01:12:21,140
Right at this moment

582
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:24,577
the biggest "R" I feel
is regret.

583
01:12:26,613 --> 01:12:29,048
Regret that maybe

584
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:32,452
the greatest warrior
I have ever met

585
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:38,593
met her end at the hands
of a bushwhackin', scrub,

586
01:12:38,660 --> 01:12:42,563
alky piece of shit like you.

587
01:12:44,499 --> 01:12:46,901
That woman deserved better.

588
01:13:30,912 --> 01:13:33,580
Bill.

589
01:13:33,648 --> 01:13:36,883
I have some tragic news.

590
01:13:36,951 --> 01:13:39,719
Your brother's dead.

591
01:13:39,787 --> 01:13:42,656
I am so sorry, baby.

592
01:13:42,723 --> 01:13:46,192
She put a black mamba
in his camper.

593
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:49,729
I got her, sweetie. She's dead.

594
01:13:51,331 --> 01:13:53,165
Let me put it this way,

595
01:13:53,233 --> 01:13:55,401
you ever start feeling
sentimental,

596
01:13:55,468 --> 01:13:57,569
go to Barstow, California.

597
01:13:57,637 --> 01:14:01,539
When you get here,
walk into a florist
and buy a bunch of flowers.

598
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:04,442
Then you take those flowers
to Huntington Cemetery

599
01:14:04,509 --> 01:14:06,444
on Fuller and Guadalupe,

600
01:14:06,512 --> 01:14:08,913
look for the headstone
marked "Paula Schultz,"

601
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:11,048
and lay them on the grave.

602
01:14:11,116 --> 01:14:16,954
'Cause you will be standing
at the final resting place
of Beatrix Kiddo.

603
01:14:17,022 --> 01:14:19,558
Marty Kitrosser?
Here.

604
01:14:19,625 --> 01:14:21,426
Melanie Harrhouse?
Here.

605
01:14:21,494 --> 01:14:23,962
Beatrix Kiddo?
Here.

606
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:27,599
Look.. I can be there
in about four hours.

607
01:14:27,667 --> 01:14:30,068
Do you want me to come over?

608
01:14:30,136 --> 01:14:33,572
No, no, no, no.
You need me, baby, I'm there.

609
01:14:36,275 --> 01:14:39,144
OK. I'm leaving now.

610
01:14:39,211 --> 01:14:42,247
You go smoke some pot
or somethin'.
I'll be there soon.

611
01:15:43,676 --> 01:15:45,643
Ugh.

612
01:15:45,711 --> 01:15:47,812
Gross.

613
01:16:07,331 --> 01:16:10,300
Yaagh!

614
01:16:43,601 --> 01:16:45,736
Agh!

615
01:16:58,583 --> 01:17:00,651
Hi-ya!

616
01:17:10,194 --> 01:17:13,364
"To my brother, Budd.
The only man I ever loved.

617
01:17:13,431 --> 01:17:15,065
Bill."

618
01:17:25,877 --> 01:17:28,980
What's that?

619
01:17:30,482 --> 01:17:32,883
Budd's Hanzo sword.

620
01:17:32,951 --> 01:17:35,418
He said he pawned it.

621
01:17:35,486 --> 01:17:39,189
Guess that makes him
a liar now, don't it?

622
01:17:42,793 --> 01:17:46,596
Elle?
Bea.

623
01:17:46,663 --> 01:17:49,566
Somethin' I've always
been curious about.

624
01:17:49,634 --> 01:17:51,902
Just between us girls,

625
01:17:53,371 --> 01:17:57,809
what did you say to Pai Mei
to make him snatch out your eye?

626
01:17:57,877 --> 01:18:00,579
Argh! Ow! Ow!

627
01:18:01,548 --> 01:18:04,783
I called him a miserable
old fool.

628
01:18:04,851 --> 01:18:07,486
Ooh.

629
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:09,956
Bad idea.

630
01:18:10,024 --> 01:18:11,758
Know what I did?

631
01:18:11,825 --> 01:18:17,163
I killed that miserable
old fool.

632
01:18:17,231 --> 01:18:20,900
How do you
like the fish head,
you miserable old fool?

633
01:18:20,968 --> 01:18:23,502
I poisoned his fish heads.

634
01:18:33,847 --> 01:18:39,319
And I told him "To me,
the word of an old fool like you"

635
01:18:39,386 --> 01:18:43,490
is worth less than nothing."

636
01:18:48,530 --> 01:18:50,431
That's right.

637
01:18:50,498 --> 01:18:52,533
I killed your master.

638
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,169
And now I'm gonna kill you, too.

639
01:18:55,237 --> 01:18:57,905
With your own sword, no less.

640
01:18:57,973 --> 01:19:04,313
Which, in the very immediate
future, will become my sword.

641
01:19:06,416 --> 01:19:08,517
Bitch.

642
01:19:08,585 --> 01:19:09,918
You don't have a future.

643
01:20:00,371 --> 01:20:02,771
Fucking bitch!

644
01:20:03,872 --> 01:20:06,773
Fucking bitch!

645
01:20:14,948 --> 01:20:18,049
I'll kill you!
You're fuckin' dead!

646
01:20:20,485 --> 01:20:23,520
You bitch! You bitch!

647
01:20:27,490 --> 01:20:30,292
I'll fucking kill you,
you bitch!

648
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,995
Oh, I'll get you!

649
01:20:37,298 --> 01:20:38,999
I'm gonna..

650
01:20:40,367 --> 01:20:43,302
Where are you?
Lemme fuckin' at you!

651
01:20:45,505 --> 01:20:49,407
Where are you?
I'm coming, you fucking bitch!

652
01:20:49,475 --> 01:20:52,209
You're fucking dead!
You're dead!

653
01:20:54,732 --> 01:20:57,748
Oh.. shit!

654
01:22:24,518 --> 01:22:26,811
Like most men
who never knew their father,

655
01:22:26,879 --> 01:22:29,602
Bill collected father figures.

656
01:22:29,670 --> 01:22:32,626
The first was Esteban Vihaio.

657
01:22:32,694 --> 01:22:36,781
Esteban was a pimp
and a friend of Bill's mother.

658
01:22:36,848 --> 01:22:40,931
He ran a brothel in Acuna,
Mexico, for over 50 years.

659
01:22:40,999 --> 01:22:43,292
His army, the Acuna Boys,

660
01:22:43,360 --> 01:22:46,980
made up of the fatherless
offspring of his whores,
ran Acuna.

661
01:22:47,048 --> 01:22:50,371
He ran the Acuna Boys.

662
01:22:52,033 --> 01:22:53,563
Now, at the age of 80,

663
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:57,083
it would be this retired
gentleman of leisure

664
01:22:57,151 --> 01:23:00,575
who could point me
in Bill's direction.

665
01:23:02,069 --> 01:23:04,529
Señor Esteban Vihaio?

666
01:23:05,957 --> 01:23:07,320
Yes.

667
01:23:07,388 --> 01:23:09,380
May I join you?

668
01:23:11,408 --> 01:23:14,564
Only on the condition
that you call me Esteban.

669
01:23:14,632 --> 01:23:19,182
May I join you, Esteban?
Please.

670
01:23:22,641 --> 01:23:25,029
<i>¿Americana?</i>

671
01:23:25,097 --> 01:23:26,789
Yes.

672
01:23:26,857 --> 01:23:29,517
I speak a little Spanish,
if you prefer.

673
01:23:29,585 --> 01:23:33,172
No, no, no, no.
I prefer English.

674
01:23:33,239 --> 01:23:35,695
I haven't spoken it in a while,

675
01:23:35,763 --> 01:23:39,120
but I would relish
the opportunity to converse

676
01:23:39,188 --> 01:23:42,044
with such a pretty
companion as yourself.

677
01:23:42,112 --> 01:23:44,071
It's my pleasure to be
in the company

678
01:23:44,139 --> 01:23:45,999
of such a fine gentleman
as yourself.

679
01:23:46,067 --> 01:23:49,557
I must warn you, young lady,

680
01:23:49,621 --> 01:23:52,482
I am susceptible to flattery.

681
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:57,696
How may I be of service to you?

682
01:24:06,108 --> 01:24:07,767
Where's Bill?

683
01:24:10,062 --> 01:24:12,685
Ahh.

684
01:24:12,752 --> 01:24:16,772
You must be Beatrix.

685
01:24:16,840 --> 01:24:20,097
I can see the attraction.

686
01:24:21,658 --> 01:24:24,848
I remember when Bill
was only five years old,

687
01:24:24,916 --> 01:24:26,975
I took him to the movies.

688
01:24:27,043 --> 01:24:30,797
It was a movie
starring Lana Turner.

689
01:24:30,865 --> 01:24:35,849
<i>The Postman Always Ring Twice,</i>
with John Garfield.

690
01:24:35,917 --> 01:24:39,174
And whenever she would
appear on the screen,

691
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:42,298
Bill would begin compulsively
to suck his thumb

692
01:24:42,366 --> 01:24:44,822
to an obscene amount.

693
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:50,549
And I knew from this very moment
this boy was a fool for blondes.

694
01:24:56,035 --> 01:24:58,136
Mmm.

695
01:24:58,204 --> 01:24:59,872
You know,

696
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:03,810
being a fool for a woman
such as yourself

697
01:25:03,878 --> 01:25:07,214
is always the right thing to do.

698
01:25:09,283 --> 01:25:14,254
If we had met
when I was back in business,

699
01:25:14,322 --> 01:25:18,925
you would have been
my number-one lady.

700
01:25:21,362 --> 01:25:25,598
Well, I'm flattered.
You goddamn well better be.

701
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:31,870
This.. I heard you
were driving a truck.

702
01:25:31,938 --> 01:25:34,873
My Pussy Wagon died on me.

703
01:25:34,941 --> 01:25:38,476
The Pussy died. Hmm.

704
01:25:40,712 --> 01:25:43,481
Bill shot you in the head, no?

705
01:25:43,548 --> 01:25:47,351
Yes.
Hmm.

706
01:25:47,419 --> 01:25:50,521
I would have been much nicer.

707
01:25:50,588 --> 01:25:52,923
I would have just cut your face.

708
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,594
You must forgive me.

709
01:25:57,662 --> 01:26:01,031
Please.. you have
a drink with me.

710
01:26:03,568 --> 01:26:07,804
Clara!

711
01:26:09,306 --> 01:26:11,140
Coming.

712
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:15,845
<i>Dos añejo.</i>

713
01:26:28,124 --> 01:26:29,625
<i>Gracias.</i>

714
01:26:34,531 --> 01:26:37,966
What were we talking about?

715
01:26:44,274 --> 01:26:46,141
Bill.

716
01:26:48,311 --> 01:26:52,047
Where's Bill?
Where's Bill.

717
01:26:52,115 --> 01:26:54,617
Yeah. Hmm.

718
01:26:54,684 --> 01:27:00,223
Bill is at the Villa Quatro,
on the road to Salina.

719
01:27:00,290 --> 01:27:04,059
I will draw you a map.

720
01:27:04,127 --> 01:27:08,030
Bill is like a son to me.

721
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:12,069
Do you know why I help you?
No.

722
01:27:12,136 --> 01:27:15,573
Because he would want me to.

723
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,008
Now, that I don't believe.

724
01:27:18,076 --> 01:27:20,511
Ahh.

725
01:27:20,579 --> 01:27:23,815
How else is he ever
going to see you again?

726
01:28:33,020 --> 01:28:34,687
Freeze, Mommy.

727
01:28:34,755 --> 01:28:36,755
Bang, bang! Oh!

728
01:28:36,823 --> 01:28:39,592
Oh! She got us, B.B.
Mommy got us.

729
01:28:39,660 --> 01:28:42,061
Oh, I'm dying.

730
01:28:42,129 --> 01:28:44,230
I'm dying.

731
01:28:46,933 --> 01:28:50,436
Fall down, sweetheart.
Mommy shot us.

732
01:28:51,905 --> 01:28:55,408
But little did
Quickdraw Kiddo know

733
01:28:55,475 --> 01:28:58,477
that little B.B.
was only playing possum,

734
01:28:58,545 --> 01:29:03,649
due to the fact that
she was impervious to bullets.

735
01:29:03,717 --> 01:29:05,851
I am pervious
to bullets, Mommy.

736
01:29:05,919 --> 01:29:09,521
Hey, get back down there.
You're playing possum.

737
01:29:09,589 --> 01:29:15,326
So, as the smirking killer
advanced on what she thought

738
01:29:15,394 --> 01:29:21,132
was a bullet-ridden corpse,
that's when little B.B. fired.

739
01:29:23,001 --> 01:29:25,102
Bang, bang!

740
01:29:31,910 --> 01:29:36,181
You're dead, Mommy. So die.

741
01:29:37,150 --> 01:29:39,184
Oh!

742
01:29:41,755 --> 01:29:43,890
B.B.

743
01:29:46,827 --> 01:29:50,697
Oh! B.B..

744
01:29:53,101 --> 01:29:56,203
I should've known.

745
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:59,606
You are.. the best.

746
01:30:06,481 --> 01:30:09,517
Oh, Mommy. Don't die.

747
01:30:09,585 --> 01:30:11,619
I was just playing.

748
01:30:16,993 --> 01:30:19,528
I know.

749
01:30:32,675 --> 01:30:35,743
I told her that you were asleep,

750
01:30:35,811 --> 01:30:40,647
but that one day you'd wake up
and come back to her.

751
01:30:40,715 --> 01:30:44,884
And she asked me, "If Mommy's
been asleep since I was born",

752
01:30:44,952 --> 01:30:47,754
then how will she know
what I look like?"

753
01:30:47,821 --> 01:30:53,460
To which I replied, "Because
Mommy's been dreaming of you."

754
01:30:55,529 --> 01:30:57,964
That's what I said.

755
01:30:58,032 --> 01:31:02,702
Did you dream of me?
I dreamed of you.

756
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:06,473
Every single night, baby.
Every single night.

757
01:31:06,540 --> 01:31:10,710
I waited a long time
for you to wake up, Mommy.

758
01:31:21,722 --> 01:31:25,457
Now, let me look at you.

759
01:31:25,525 --> 01:31:27,659
Oh.

760
01:31:30,930 --> 01:31:34,866
My, my, my, what a pretty
little girl you are.

761
01:31:34,934 --> 01:31:37,703
You're pretty too, Mommy.

762
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:46,612
Tell Mommy what you said
when I showed you her picture.

763
01:31:46,680 --> 01:31:47,780
Mm-mm.

764
01:31:47,848 --> 01:31:50,516
Come on, shy girl.
Mm-mm.

765
01:31:50,584 --> 01:31:53,252
Come on.
You know what you said.

766
01:31:53,320 --> 01:31:56,755
Come on. Tell Mommy.
It'll make her feel good.

767
01:31:56,823 --> 01:31:58,690
Come on.
Mm-mm.

768
01:31:58,758 --> 01:32:00,159
Yeah. Come on.

769
01:32:00,226 --> 01:32:02,794
I said.. I said

770
01:32:02,862 --> 01:32:04,897
"You're the most
beautifulest woman

771
01:32:04,965 --> 01:32:09,268
I ever saw
in the whole wide world."

772
01:32:10,803 --> 01:32:14,373
That's the truth.
That's what she said.

773
01:32:14,441 --> 01:32:19,245
B.B., don't you think Mommy
has the prettiest hair

774
01:32:19,312 --> 01:32:21,214
in the whole wide world?

775
01:32:21,281 --> 01:32:25,151
Yes, I do.
Matter of fact,
it's better than pretty.

776
01:32:26,620 --> 01:32:31,224
What's better than pretty?
Mmm.. Gorgeous.

777
01:32:31,292 --> 01:32:34,794
Very good. Gorgeous.

778
01:32:34,862 --> 01:32:38,198
Mommy is gorgeous.

779
01:32:38,266 --> 01:32:44,037
Hmm. You know, sweetie,
Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.

780
01:32:44,105 --> 01:32:47,074
Why, Daddy?
Were you being a bad daddy?

781
01:32:47,141 --> 01:32:52,779
I'm afraid I was.
I was a real bad daddy.

782
01:32:52,847 --> 01:32:56,818
Our little girl learned about
life and death the other day.

783
01:32:56,885 --> 01:33:01,389
Wanna tell Mommy about
what happened to Emilio?

784
01:33:03,725 --> 01:33:06,660
I killed him.

785
01:33:06,728 --> 01:33:11,833
Emilio was her goldfish.
Emilio was my goldfiss.

786
01:33:11,901 --> 01:33:14,169
She came running into my room,

787
01:33:14,237 --> 01:33:16,639
holding the fish in her hand
and crying,

788
01:33:16,707 --> 01:33:19,642
"Daddy! Daddy! Emilio's dead."

789
01:33:21,412 --> 01:33:25,415
And I said,
"Really? That's so sad."

790
01:33:25,483 --> 01:33:27,650
"How did he die?"

791
01:33:27,718 --> 01:33:30,820
And what did you say?
I stepped on him.

792
01:33:30,888 --> 01:33:36,092
Actually, young lady, the words
you so strategically used were

793
01:33:36,160 --> 01:33:40,096
"I accidentally stepped on him."

794
01:33:40,164 --> 01:33:42,064
To which I queried,

795
01:33:42,132 --> 01:33:44,901
"And just how did
your foot accidentally

796
01:33:44,969 --> 01:33:47,703
find its way
into Emilio's fishbowl?"

797
01:33:47,771 --> 01:33:49,138
And she said, "No, no, no."

798
01:33:49,206 --> 01:33:52,041
Emilio was on the carpet
when I stepped on him."

799
01:33:52,109 --> 01:33:56,046
Mmm. The plot thickens.

800
01:33:56,114 --> 01:34:01,084
"And just how did Emilio
get on the carpet?"

801
01:34:01,152 --> 01:34:04,922
And, Mommy, you would've
been so proud of her.

802
01:34:06,491 --> 01:34:08,892
She didn't lie.

803
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,130
She said she took Emilio
out of his bowl

804
01:34:13,198 --> 01:34:16,667
and put him on the carpet.

805
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:22,340
And what was Emilio
doing on the carpet?

806
01:34:22,407 --> 01:34:25,276
Flapping.

807
01:34:25,344 --> 01:34:28,781
And then you stomped on him.
Uh-huh.

808
01:34:28,848 --> 01:34:33,019
And when you lifted up
your foot,

809
01:34:33,087 --> 01:34:37,257
what was Emilio doing then?
Nothing.

810
01:34:37,325 --> 01:34:40,060
He stopped flapping,
didn't he?

811
01:34:42,463 --> 01:34:44,932
She told me later

812
01:34:45,000 --> 01:34:47,401
that the second
she lifted up her foot

813
01:34:47,469 --> 01:34:51,705
and saw Emilio not flapping,
she knew what she had done.

814
01:34:51,773 --> 01:34:56,844
Is that not the perfect
visual image of life and death?

815
01:34:56,912 --> 01:34:59,080
A fish flapping on the carpet,

816
01:34:59,147 --> 01:35:02,483
and a fish not flapping
on the carpet.

817
01:35:04,219 --> 01:35:06,086
So powerful,

818
01:35:06,154 --> 01:35:09,656
even a four-year-old
with no concept of life or death

819
01:35:09,724 --> 01:35:11,791
knew what it meant.

820
01:35:13,727 --> 01:35:16,596
You loved Emilio,
didn't you?
Uh-huh.

821
01:35:16,663 --> 01:35:19,932
Well, I love Mommy, too.

822
01:35:21,268 --> 01:35:23,469
But I did to Mommy
what you did to Emilio.

823
01:35:23,536 --> 01:35:27,406
You stomped on Mommy?
Worse.

824
01:35:27,473 --> 01:35:29,241
I shot Mommy.

825
01:35:29,309 --> 01:35:32,912
Not pretend shooting
like we were just doing.

826
01:35:32,979 --> 01:35:34,647
I shot her for real.

827
01:35:34,715 --> 01:35:37,216
Why? Did you want to see
what would happen?

828
01:35:37,284 --> 01:35:42,055
No, I knew what would happen
to Mommy if I shot her.

829
01:35:42,122 --> 01:35:44,090
What I didn't know was,

830
01:35:44,158 --> 01:35:46,560
when I shot Mommy,
what would happen to me.

831
01:35:46,627 --> 01:35:50,463
What happened?
I was very sad.

832
01:35:52,666 --> 01:35:54,834
And that's when I learned

833
01:35:54,902 --> 01:35:59,974
some things, once you do,
they can never be undone.

834
01:36:02,911 --> 01:36:08,349
What happened to Mommy?
Why don't you ask Mommy?

835
01:36:08,417 --> 01:36:11,585
You OK, Mommy? Did it hurt?

836
01:36:11,653 --> 01:36:13,721
No, sweetie.

837
01:36:15,491 --> 01:36:17,792
Doesn't hurt anymore.

838
01:36:23,432 --> 01:36:26,734
Did it make you sick?

839
01:36:26,802 --> 01:36:31,272
No. It made me sleep.

840
01:36:31,339 --> 01:36:34,375
That's why I haven't been
with you, B.B.
I've been asleep.

841
01:36:34,443 --> 01:36:37,745
But you're awake now, Mommy.
Right?

842
01:36:37,813 --> 01:36:40,915
I'm wide awake, pretty girl.

843
01:36:40,983 --> 01:36:44,586
B.B., would you like Mommy
to watch a video with you

844
01:36:44,654 --> 01:36:46,321
before sleepy time?

845
01:36:46,389 --> 01:36:47,822
Uh-huh.

846
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:51,659
Mommy, do you wanna
watch a video with me
before sleepy time?

847
01:36:51,727 --> 01:36:54,429
Oh, yeah! I would love to.

848
01:36:54,496 --> 01:36:56,898
Which one do you
wanna watch?
Shogun Assassin.

849
01:36:56,965 --> 01:36:59,767
No, B.B. Shogun Assassin
is too long.

850
01:36:59,835 --> 01:37:03,838
Mm-mm.
No, it's not.

851
01:37:03,905 --> 01:37:06,507
Well, then,

852
01:37:06,575 --> 01:37:09,009
I'll leave you ladies to it.

853
01:37:14,949 --> 01:37:20,387
When I was little,
my father was famous.

854
01:37:20,455 --> 01:37:24,892
He was the greatest samurai
in the empire.

855
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:28,129
And he was the shogun's
decapitator.

856
01:37:28,197 --> 01:37:33,468
He cut off the heads
of 131 lords.

857
01:37:33,536 --> 01:37:36,137
My father would
come home to Mother,

858
01:37:36,205 --> 01:37:38,173
and when he would see her

859
01:37:38,240 --> 01:37:40,842
he would forget
about the killings.

860
01:37:40,909 --> 01:37:43,010
He wasn't scared of the shogun,

861
01:37:43,078 --> 01:37:46,080
but the shogun
was scared of him.

862
01:37:46,148 --> 01:37:48,849
Maybe that was the problem.

863
01:37:48,917 --> 01:37:51,885
One night, the shogun sent..

864
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:16,358
I was just admiring your sword.

865
01:40:16,426 --> 01:40:19,962
Quite a piece of work.

866
01:40:20,030 --> 01:40:24,867
Speaking of which,
how is Hanzo-san?

867
01:40:24,935 --> 01:40:28,304
He's good.

868
01:40:28,372 --> 01:40:31,407
Has his sushi
gotten any better?

869
01:40:34,578 --> 01:40:39,215
You know, I couldn't believe it.
You got him to make you a sword.

870
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:41,384
It was easy.

871
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:43,619
I just dropped your name, Bill.

872
01:40:43,687 --> 01:40:45,855
That'd do it.

873
01:41:17,088 --> 01:41:20,891
I suppose the idea is
we cross Hanzo swords.

874
01:41:20,959 --> 01:41:24,261
Am I right?

875
01:41:24,329 --> 01:41:27,598
Well, it just so happens

876
01:41:27,665 --> 01:41:31,268
this hacienda has
its own private beach.

877
01:41:31,336 --> 01:41:33,437
And that private beach
just so happens

878
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,539
to look particularly beautiful

879
01:41:35,607 --> 01:41:38,609
bathed in moonlight.

880
01:41:38,676 --> 01:41:41,479
And there just so happens
to be a full moon out tonight.

881
01:41:41,546 --> 01:41:44,448
So, sword fighter,

882
01:41:44,516 --> 01:41:48,319
if you want a sword fight,
that's where I suggest.

883
01:41:48,387 --> 01:41:52,690
But if you wanna be
old school about it

884
01:41:52,758 --> 01:41:56,327
- and you know
I'm all about old school -

885
01:41:56,395 --> 01:42:00,164
then we could wait until dawn
and slice each other up
at sunrise

886
01:42:00,232 --> 01:42:02,533
like a couple
of real-life, honest..

887
01:42:04,436 --> 01:42:07,372
Now, if you don't settle down,

888
01:42:07,439 --> 01:42:09,774
I'm gonna have to put one
in your kneecap.

889
01:42:09,842 --> 01:42:13,078
And I hear tell that's
a very painful place
to get shot in.

890
01:42:17,784 --> 01:42:20,353
I'm just fuckin' with you.

891
01:42:20,421 --> 01:42:25,459
Now, when it comes to you

892
01:42:25,526 --> 01:42:27,561
and us

893
01:42:29,163 --> 01:42:32,298
I have a few
unanswered questions.

894
01:42:32,366 --> 01:42:36,270
So, before this tale
of bloody revenge

895
01:42:36,337 --> 01:42:38,338
reaches its climax,

896
01:42:38,406 --> 01:42:41,175
I'm gonna ask you
some questions,

897
01:42:41,242 --> 01:42:44,211
and I want you
to tell me the truth.

898
01:42:44,278 --> 01:42:48,583
However, therein lies a dilemma.

899
01:42:48,650 --> 01:42:51,185
Because when it comes
to the subject of me,

900
01:42:51,253 --> 01:42:54,589
I believe you are
truly and utterly

901
01:42:54,657 --> 01:42:56,591
incapable of telling the truth.

902
01:42:56,659 --> 01:43:01,029
Especially to me.
And least of all, to yourself.

903
01:43:01,097 --> 01:43:04,600
And when it comes
to the subject of me,

904
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:07,236
I am truly and utterly

905
01:43:07,303 --> 01:43:11,474
incapable of believing
anything you say.

906
01:43:11,542 --> 01:43:13,409
How do you suppose
we solve this dilemma?

907
01:43:13,477 --> 01:43:17,514
Well, it just so happens,

908
01:43:17,582 --> 01:43:19,684
I have a solution.

909
01:43:19,751 --> 01:43:22,186
Agh!
Gotcha!

910
01:43:22,254 --> 01:43:24,422
God damn!

911
01:43:26,926 --> 01:43:30,362
What the fuck did you
just shoot me with?

912
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:34,066
My greatest invention.
Or at least my favorite.

913
01:43:34,134 --> 01:43:35,768
Don't touch it,

914
01:43:35,836 --> 01:43:37,804
or I'll stick another one
right in your cheek.

915
01:43:42,476 --> 01:43:44,877
What lies within that dart,

916
01:43:44,945 --> 01:43:48,815
just begging to course
its way through your veins

917
01:43:48,883 --> 01:43:50,784
is an incredibly potent

918
01:43:50,852 --> 01:43:53,420
and quite infallible
truth serum.

919
01:43:53,488 --> 01:43:56,623
I call it
"The Undisputed Truth."

920
01:43:56,691 --> 01:43:59,092
Twice as strong
as sodium pentothal,

921
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:02,196
with no druggie aftereffects.

922
01:44:02,263 --> 01:44:07,968
Except for a slight wave
of euphoria. You feel it?

923
01:44:08,036 --> 01:44:10,604
Euphoria?
Yeah.

924
01:44:10,672 --> 01:44:13,774
No.
Too bad.

925
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:17,578
As you know,

926
01:44:17,645 --> 01:44:21,015
I'm quite keen on comic books.

927
01:44:21,083 --> 01:44:24,718
Especially the ones
about superheroes.

928
01:44:24,786 --> 01:44:30,356
I find the whole mythology
surrounding superheroes
fascinating.

929
01:44:30,424 --> 01:44:35,027
Take my favorite superhero,
Superman.

930
01:44:35,095 --> 01:44:38,197
Not a great comic book.
Not particularly well drawn.

931
01:44:39,766 --> 01:44:41,466
Mmm.

932
01:44:41,534 --> 01:44:44,035
But the mythology..

933
01:44:44,103 --> 01:44:47,471
The mythology is not only
great, it's unique.

934
01:44:47,539 --> 01:44:51,809
How long does this shit take
to go into effect?

935
01:44:51,877 --> 01:44:53,244
About two minutes.

936
01:44:53,312 --> 01:44:55,780
Just long enough for me
to finish my point.

937
01:44:55,848 --> 01:45:01,186
Now, a staple of
the superhero mythology is,

938
01:45:01,254 --> 01:45:04,156
there's the superhero
and there's the alter ego.

939
01:45:04,224 --> 01:45:06,391
Batman is actually Bruce Wayne,

940
01:45:06,459 --> 01:45:09,661
Spider-Man is actually
Peter Parker.

941
01:45:09,729 --> 01:45:11,629
When that character
wakes up in the morning,

942
01:45:11,697 --> 01:45:13,431
he's Peter Parker.

943
01:45:13,499 --> 01:45:18,670
He has to put on a costume
to become Spider-Man.

944
01:45:18,738 --> 01:45:24,642
And it is in that characteristic
Superman stands alone.

945
01:45:24,710 --> 01:45:27,478
Superman didn't become Superman.

946
01:45:27,546 --> 01:45:30,348
Superman was born Superman.

947
01:45:30,415 --> 01:45:34,652
When Superman wakes up
in the morning, he's Superman.

948
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,256
His alter ego is Clark Kent.

949
01:45:38,324 --> 01:45:41,526
His outfit with the big red "S,"

950
01:45:41,594 --> 01:45:43,795
that's the blanket
he was wrapped in as a baby

951
01:45:43,863 --> 01:45:48,066
when the Kents found him.
Those are his clothes.

952
01:45:48,134 --> 01:45:51,536
What Kent wears - the glasses,
the business suit -

953
01:45:51,604 --> 01:45:53,438
that's the costume.

954
01:45:53,506 --> 01:45:58,243
That's the costume Superman
wears to blend in with us.

955
01:45:59,679 --> 01:46:03,148
Clark Kent is how Superman
views us.

956
01:46:03,216 --> 01:46:06,584
And what are the characteristics
of Clark Kent?

957
01:46:06,652 --> 01:46:08,920
He's weak,

958
01:46:08,988 --> 01:46:11,923
he's unsure of himself,

959
01:46:11,990 --> 01:46:14,692
he's a coward.

960
01:46:14,760 --> 01:46:17,195
Clark Kent is
Superman's critique

961
01:46:17,262 --> 01:46:19,898
on the whole human race.

962
01:46:21,333 --> 01:46:26,104
Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo
and Mrs. Tommy Plympton.

963
01:46:27,273 --> 01:46:29,441
Aso.

964
01:46:29,508 --> 01:46:31,843
The point emerges.

965
01:46:33,546 --> 01:46:37,015
You would've worn the costume
of Arlene Plympton.

966
01:46:37,083 --> 01:46:40,852
But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.

967
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:43,521
And every morning
when you woke up,

968
01:46:43,589 --> 01:46:45,957
you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.

969
01:46:46,025 --> 01:46:49,427
Oh, you can take
the needle out.

970
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:57,836
Are you calling me a superhero?

971
01:46:57,904 --> 01:47:00,038
I'm calling you a killer.

972
01:47:00,106 --> 01:47:03,008
A natural-born killer.

973
01:47:03,076 --> 01:47:06,712
You always have been,
and you always will be.

974
01:47:06,780 --> 01:47:09,014
Moving to El Paso,

975
01:47:09,082 --> 01:47:12,551
working in
a used-record store,

976
01:47:12,619 --> 01:47:16,755
goin' to the movies with Tommy,
clipping coupons.

977
01:47:16,823 --> 01:47:18,624
That's you

978
01:47:18,692 --> 01:47:22,260
trying to disguise yourself
as a worker bee.

979
01:47:22,328 --> 01:47:25,297
That's you tryin'
to blend in with the hive.

980
01:47:25,365 --> 01:47:28,666
But you're not a worker bee.

981
01:47:28,734 --> 01:47:31,502
You're a renegade killer bee.

982
01:47:31,570 --> 01:47:34,372
And no matter how much beer
you drank or barbecue you ate

983
01:47:34,439 --> 01:47:37,741
or how fat your ass got,

984
01:47:37,809 --> 01:47:41,712
nothing in the world
would ever change that.

985
01:47:44,115 --> 01:47:46,316
First question:

986
01:47:48,419 --> 01:47:53,789
did you really think your life
in El Paso was gonna work?

987
01:47:59,463 --> 01:48:01,531
No!

988
01:48:04,668 --> 01:48:07,603
But I would've had B.B.!

989
01:48:07,671 --> 01:48:10,406
Don't get me wrong.

990
01:48:10,474 --> 01:48:14,377
I think you would have been
a wonderful mother.

991
01:48:14,444 --> 01:48:17,080
But you are a killer.

992
01:48:21,118 --> 01:48:23,986
All those people you killed
to get to me

993
01:48:24,054 --> 01:48:26,455
felt damn good, didn't they?

994
01:48:28,592 --> 01:48:31,060
Yes.

995
01:48:31,128 --> 01:48:33,730
Every single one of them?

996
01:48:43,676 --> 01:48:46,578
Yes.

997
01:48:48,815 --> 01:48:51,417
That was the warmup round.

998
01:48:51,484 --> 01:48:56,922
Now comes the $64,000 question.

999
01:49:03,529 --> 01:49:07,131
Why did you run away from me
with my baby?

1000
01:49:10,937 --> 01:49:14,339
Do you remember the last
assignment you sent me on?

1001
01:49:14,406 --> 01:49:16,875
Of course.

1002
01:49:16,943 --> 01:49:20,245
Lisa Wong.

1003
01:49:20,313 --> 01:49:24,483
The morning I left, I was sick.

1004
01:49:24,551 --> 01:49:28,954
On the plane, I threw up.

1005
01:49:29,022 --> 01:49:32,891
So I started thinking

1006
01:49:32,958 --> 01:49:35,093
maybe I was pregnant.

1007
01:49:35,160 --> 01:49:36,927
"Easy to use.

1008
01:49:36,995 --> 01:49:39,663
Remove cap and urinate
on the absorbent end
for five seconds."

1009
01:49:41,766 --> 01:49:44,301
"Accurate results
in only 90 seconds."

1010
01:49:44,368 --> 01:49:47,938
"You can read the results
as soon as the line appears
in the window."

1011
01:50:24,277 --> 01:50:25,377
Fuck.

1012
01:50:25,445 --> 01:50:27,546
What I didn't know

1013
01:50:27,613 --> 01:50:29,548
was that somewhere
on my journey

1014
01:50:29,615 --> 01:50:31,783
I had been spotted.

1015
01:50:31,851 --> 01:50:35,320
With me in L.A.,
it didn't take Lisa Wong long

1016
01:50:35,387 --> 01:50:37,821
to send an assassin of her own.

1017
01:50:37,889 --> 01:50:40,791
Hello,
can I help you?

1018
01:50:40,859 --> 01:50:43,627
Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
I'm the hospitality manager
of the hotel.

1019
01:50:43,695 --> 01:50:46,096
I have a welcome gift
from the management.

1020
01:50:46,163 --> 01:50:49,132
Oh, that's nice. Um..

1021
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:51,367
Can you just leave it
by the door?

1022
01:51:03,745 --> 01:51:05,112
You pretty good
with that shotgun?

1023
01:51:05,180 --> 01:51:07,114
Not that I have to be
at this range,

1024
01:51:07,182 --> 01:51:08,949
but I'm a fuckin' surgeon
with this shotgun.

1025
01:51:09,017 --> 01:51:11,819
Well, guess what, bitch.
I'm better than Annie Oakley,

1026
01:51:11,886 --> 01:51:13,687
and I got you
right in my sight.

1027
01:51:13,755 --> 01:51:15,656
I could blow
your fuckin' head off.

1028
01:51:15,724 --> 01:51:19,794
Not before I put one
right between your eyes,
so let's talk.

1029
01:51:21,397 --> 01:51:23,831
Karen..

1030
01:51:25,534 --> 01:51:27,869
I just found out

1031
01:51:27,937 --> 01:51:29,905
right now

1032
01:51:29,972 --> 01:51:36,045
not a moment before you blew
a hole through the door

1033
01:51:36,113 --> 01:51:40,316
that I'm pregnant.
What is this?

1034
01:51:40,384 --> 01:51:43,287
On the floor by the door

1035
01:51:43,354 --> 01:51:46,456
is a strip that says
I'm pregnant.

1036
01:51:46,524 --> 01:51:48,992
Bullshit.

1037
01:51:49,060 --> 01:51:52,629
Any other time
you'd be 100 percent right.

1038
01:51:52,697 --> 01:51:55,799
This time

1039
01:51:55,867 --> 01:51:58,736
you're 100 percent wrong.

1040
01:52:00,171 --> 01:52:03,807
I'm the deadliest woman
in the world.

1041
01:52:03,875 --> 01:52:06,143
But right now

1042
01:52:06,211 --> 01:52:09,580
I'm just scared shitless
for my baby.

1043
01:52:09,648 --> 01:52:12,383
Please.

1044
01:52:12,450 --> 01:52:14,918
Just look at the strip.

1045
01:52:16,955 --> 01:52:18,722
Please!

1046
01:52:20,058 --> 01:52:24,495
Stay where you are
and don't move.

1047
01:52:42,014 --> 01:52:44,215
I don't know what
this fuckin' shit means.

1048
01:52:44,283 --> 01:52:46,684
The box with the directions -
it's right there.

1049
01:52:58,530 --> 01:53:00,198
"Easy to use."

1050
01:53:00,265 --> 01:53:04,803
"Remove the cap and urinate
on the absorbent end."

1051
01:53:04,870 --> 01:53:06,504
Blue means pregnant.

1052
01:53:06,572 --> 01:53:09,841
I'll read it myself,
thank you.

1053
01:53:16,215 --> 01:53:20,818
Oh, OK. Say I were
to believe you. What then?

1054
01:53:20,886 --> 01:53:23,454
Just go home.

1055
01:53:25,357 --> 01:53:27,425
I'll do the same.

1056
01:53:47,012 --> 01:53:48,646
Congratulations.

1057
01:53:52,284 --> 01:53:55,085
Before that strip turned blue

1058
01:53:55,153 --> 01:53:58,589
I was a woman. I was your woman.

1059
01:53:58,657 --> 01:54:02,059
I was a killer
who killed for you.

1060
01:54:02,127 --> 01:54:03,861
Before that strip turned blue,

1061
01:54:03,929 --> 01:54:08,432
I would've jumped a motorcycle
onto a speeding train.

1062
01:54:08,500 --> 01:54:11,736
For you.

1063
01:54:11,804 --> 01:54:15,172
But once that strip turned blue

1064
01:54:15,240 --> 01:54:18,743
I could no longer
do any of those things.

1065
01:54:18,811 --> 01:54:21,279
Not anymore.

1066
01:54:21,347 --> 01:54:24,816
Because I was gonna be a mother.

1067
01:54:27,019 --> 01:54:29,888
Can you understand that?

1068
01:54:31,991 --> 01:54:34,693
Yes.

1069
01:54:34,761 --> 01:54:40,032
But why didn't you tell me then,
instead of now?

1070
01:54:40,099 --> 01:54:42,467
Once you knew, you'd claim her.

1071
01:54:42,535 --> 01:54:44,436
And I didn't want that.

1072
01:54:44,504 --> 01:54:47,506
Not your decision to make.

1073
01:54:47,574 --> 01:54:49,808
Yes.

1074
01:54:49,876 --> 01:54:54,046
But it's the right decision,
and I made it for my daughter.

1075
01:54:54,114 --> 01:54:58,851
She deserved to be born
with a clean slate.

1076
01:54:58,919 --> 01:55:02,155
But with you
she would've been born

1077
01:55:02,223 --> 01:55:05,091
into a world she shouldn't have.

1078
01:55:06,560 --> 01:55:09,729
I had to choose.

1079
01:55:09,797 --> 01:55:11,864
I chose her.

1080
01:55:14,368 --> 01:55:17,170
You know, five years ago,

1081
01:55:17,237 --> 01:55:20,106
if I had to make a list
of impossible things

1082
01:55:20,173 --> 01:55:22,141
that could never happen,

1083
01:55:22,209 --> 01:55:24,310
you performing
a coup de grâce on me

1084
01:55:24,377 --> 01:55:27,746
by bustin' a cap in my crown

1085
01:55:30,317 --> 01:55:33,118
would've been right
at the top of the list.

1086
01:55:34,687 --> 01:55:37,890
I'd have been wrong,
wouldn't I?

1087
01:55:37,958 --> 01:55:39,825
I'm sorry.

1088
01:55:39,893 --> 01:55:43,195
Was that a question?

1089
01:55:43,263 --> 01:55:45,964
Of impossible things
that could never happen,

1090
01:55:46,032 --> 01:55:50,168
yes, in this instance,
you would've been wrong.

1091
01:55:50,236 --> 01:55:52,136
Well?

1092
01:55:52,204 --> 01:55:54,839
When you never came back,

1093
01:55:54,906 --> 01:55:58,075
I naturally assumed Lisa Wong,

1094
01:55:58,143 --> 01:56:01,079
or somebody else,
had killed you.

1095
01:56:01,146 --> 01:56:04,382
Oh! And for the record,

1096
01:56:04,450 --> 01:56:07,452
letting somebody think
somebody they love is dead

1097
01:56:07,519 --> 01:56:11,322
when they're not
is quite cruel.

1098
01:56:14,126 --> 01:56:18,729
I mourned you for three months.

1099
01:56:18,797 --> 01:56:23,134
And in the third month
of mourning you

1100
01:56:23,202 --> 01:56:25,703
I tracked you down.

1101
01:56:25,771 --> 01:56:27,838
I wasn't tryin'
to track you down.

1102
01:56:27,906 --> 01:56:33,277
I was tryin' to track down
the fucking assholes
I thought killed you.

1103
01:56:33,345 --> 01:56:36,848
So I find you.

1104
01:56:36,915 --> 01:56:39,116
And what do I find?

1105
01:56:39,184 --> 01:56:42,587
Not only are you not dead,

1106
01:56:42,654 --> 01:56:47,224
you're getting married
to some fucking jerk.

1107
01:56:49,094 --> 01:56:51,729
And you're pregnant.

1108
01:56:54,832 --> 01:56:57,267
I.. overreacted.

1109
01:57:05,842 --> 01:57:09,745
You overreacted?
Is that your explanation?

1110
01:57:09,813 --> 01:57:12,147
I didn't say I was
gonna explain myself.

1111
01:57:12,215 --> 01:57:14,650
I said I was gonna
tell you the truth.

1112
01:57:14,717 --> 01:57:20,022
But if that's too cryptic,
let's get literal.

1113
01:57:21,692 --> 01:57:24,194
I'm a killer.

1114
01:57:24,262 --> 01:57:27,598
I'm a murdering bastard.
You know that.

1115
01:57:27,666 --> 01:57:30,634
And there are consequences

1116
01:57:30,702 --> 01:57:34,972
to breaking the heart
of a murdering bastard.

1117
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,775
You experienced some of them.

1118
01:57:41,114 --> 01:57:44,717
Was my reaction really
that surprising?

1119
01:57:44,784 --> 01:57:48,988
Yes. It was.

1120
01:57:50,991 --> 01:57:54,727
Could you do what you did?

1121
01:57:54,795 --> 01:57:58,531
Of course you could.

1122
01:57:58,599 --> 01:58:02,669
But I never thought
you would, or could,

1123
01:58:02,737 --> 01:58:05,038
do that to me.

1124
01:58:05,106 --> 01:58:08,107
I'm really sorry, Kiddo,

1125
01:58:08,175 --> 01:58:10,409
but you thought wrong.

1126
01:58:16,582 --> 01:58:20,719
You and I have
unfinished business.

1127
01:58:20,786 --> 01:58:24,989
Baby.. you ain't kiddin'.

1128
01:58:57,890 --> 01:58:59,590
Pai Mei taught you

1129
01:58:59,658 --> 01:59:03,427
the Five-Point-Palm
Exploding-Heart Technique?

1130
01:59:06,598 --> 01:59:08,732
'Course he did.

1131
01:59:10,635 --> 01:59:13,637
Why didn't you tell me?

1132
01:59:16,541 --> 01:59:18,776
I don't know.

1133
01:59:21,012 --> 01:59:23,881
Because I'm

1134
01:59:23,949 --> 01:59:26,617
a bad person.

1135
01:59:26,685 --> 01:59:28,753
No.

1136
01:59:30,722 --> 01:59:33,791
You're not a bad person.

1137
01:59:33,859 --> 01:59:36,794
You're a terrific person.

1138
01:59:36,862 --> 01:59:39,297
You're my favorite person.

1139
01:59:41,233 --> 01:59:45,203
But every once in a while

1140
01:59:45,271 --> 01:59:47,339
you can be a real cunt.

1141
02:00:06,826 --> 02:00:08,827
How do I look?

1142
02:00:24,407 --> 02:00:26,808
You look ready.

1143
02:02:13,575 --> 02:02:18,013
Well, well, well.
If it ain't the little flower.

1144
02:02:23,587 --> 02:02:26,288
Good evening,
Mr. and Mrs. America
and all the ships at sea.

1145
02:02:26,356 --> 02:02:28,223
Let's go to press. Flash.

1146
02:02:28,291 --> 02:02:31,026
Do you have a magpie
in your home?

1147
02:02:31,094 --> 02:02:33,461
If you do,
you are most fortunate.

1148
02:02:33,529 --> 02:02:37,198
The magpie is the most
charming bird in all the world.

1149
02:02:37,266 --> 02:02:39,734
He is the best friend
a farmer ever had.

1150
02:02:39,802 --> 02:02:42,870
Treat him gently.
Treat him kindly.

1151
02:02:42,938 --> 02:02:44,872
And always remember,

1152
02:02:44,940 --> 02:02:47,475
the magpie deserves
your respect.

1153
02:03:23,481 --> 02:03:25,949
Thank you.

1154
02:03:26,016 --> 02:03:29,986
Thank you. Thank you.

1155
02:03:30,054 --> 02:03:32,455
Oh, thank you.

1156
02:03:34,759 --> 02:03:36,459
Now, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

1157
02:03:36,527 --> 02:03:39,162
I ain't got no headache.

1158
02:03:39,230 --> 02:03:42,566
Oh, yes, you have,
brother.

1159
02:03:53,000 --> 02:03:57,600
