1
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,863
Whoa.

2
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:04,329
Whoa.

3
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,971
Who's that stumblin'
around in the dark?

4
00:04:22,138 --> 00:04:25,934
State your business
or prepare to get winged!

5
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,686
Calm yourselves, gentlemen.

6
00:04:28,853 --> 00:04:31,189
I mean you no harm.

7
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:36,194
I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
Whoa, boy.

8
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,197
Good cold evening, gentlemen.

9
00:04:39,364 --> 00:04:41,699
I'm looking for a pair of slave traders

10
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,534
that go by the name
of the Speck Brothers.

11
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,536
Might that be you?

12
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,666
- Who wants to know?
- Well, I do.

13
00:04:49,832 --> 00:04:51,709
I'm Dr. King Schultz.
This is my horse, Fritz.

14
00:04:52,961 --> 00:04:56,464
- What kinda doctor?
- Dentist.

15
00:04:56,631 --> 00:04:58,424
Now, are you the Speck Brothers?

16
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,386
And did you purchase those men
at the Greenville slave auction?

17
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:04,138
- So what?
- So I wish to parley with you.

18
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:07,642
- Speak English.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

19
00:05:07,809 --> 00:05:10,019
Please forgive me.
It is a second language.

20
00:05:10,186 --> 00:05:13,481
Now, amongst your inventory,
I've been led to believe,

21
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:16,067
is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.

22
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:17,694
Hello, you poor devils!

23
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:21,614
Is there one amongst you
who was formerly a resident

24
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,076
of the Carrucan plantation?

25
00:05:25,827 --> 00:05:28,037
I'm from the Carrucan plantation.

26
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,040
Who said that?

27
00:06:18,254 --> 00:06:19,630
What's your name?

28
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,678
Django.

29
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:28,598
Then you are exactly
the one I'm looking for.

30
00:06:30,475 --> 00:06:32,685
Do you know who
the Brittle Brothers are?

31
00:06:36,314 --> 00:06:37,315
Who are they?

32
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:41,360
Big John.

33
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:43,488
Ellis.

34
00:06:44,906 --> 00:06:48,826
Roger.
Sometime they call him Lil Raj.

35
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,413
They was overseers
at the Carrucan plantation.

36
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,664
Not anymore.

37
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:57,794
Tell me...

38
00:06:58,377 --> 00:07:01,172
...if you were to see
any of these three gentlemen again,

39
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:04,008
- would you recognize them?
- Hey.

40
00:07:04,175 --> 00:07:06,636
- Stop talkin' to him like that.
- Like What?

41
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:08,346
Like that.

42
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:10,807
My good man,
I'm simply trying to ascertain...

43
00:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,017
Speak English, goddamn it.

44
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:14,936
Everybody calm down.

45
00:07:15,103 --> 00:07:18,815
I'm simply a customer
trying to conduct a transaction.

46
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,984
I don't care. No sale.
Now, off with ya.

47
00:07:22,151 --> 00:07:25,154
Don't be ridiculous.
Of course they're for sale.

48
00:07:25,988 --> 00:07:27,448
Move it.

49
00:07:27,615 --> 00:07:32,537
My good man, did you simply get carried
away with your dramatic gesture

50
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:36,499
or are you pointing your weapon at me
with lethal intention?

51
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,460
Last chance, fancy pants.

52
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:43,214
Oh, very well.

53
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:14,412
I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast,

54
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,497
but I didn't want you
to do anything rash

55
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:18,958
before you had a moment
to come to your senses.

56
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:22,545
You goddamn son of a bitch!

57
00:08:22,712 --> 00:08:25,506
- You shot Roscoe!
- Well...

58
00:08:25,673 --> 00:08:27,383
And you killed Ace!

59
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,219
I only shot your brother once
he threatened to shoot me.

60
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:33,222
And I do believe I have...
one, two, three, four...

61
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,350
...five witnesses
who can attest to that fact.

62
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:39,395
- Damn leg's busted!
- No doubt.

63
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:42,106
Now, if you could keep your
caterwauling down to a minimum,

64
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:45,610
I'd like to finish my line
of inquiry with young Django.

65
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:53,075
- God-fuckin'-damn it!
- As I was saying...

66
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:56,954
...if you were to see the Brittle
Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?

67
00:08:57,622 --> 00:08:59,332
Yeah.

68
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:00,791
Sold American!

69
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:04,921
So, Mr. Speck? Mr. Speck?
How much for young Django here?

70
00:09:10,218 --> 00:09:12,845
That iron is nasty business.

71
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:20,186
Oh, could you hold this for a moment?

72
00:09:22,313 --> 00:09:23,814
Thank you. Django?

73
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:25,858
Get up on that horse.

74
00:09:26,025 --> 00:09:27,818
Also, if I were you,

75
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:31,989
I'd take that winter coat
the dear departed Speck left behind.

76
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,007
Nigger!
Don't you touch my brother's coat.

77
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:05,606
Goddamn it! Oh!

78
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:12,446
One hundred... ten... 20...

79
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,448
...and five...

80
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,867
...for young Django here.

81
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:19,203
And since he won't
be needing it anymore,

82
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,872
I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.

83
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:27,545
Also, Mr. Speck, I'm afraid
I will require a bill of sale.

84
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:29,297
Do you have one?

85
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:32,383
You go to hell, dentist.

86
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:34,552
I thought not.

87
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:38,222
No worries. I come prepared.

88
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,145
Thank you.

89
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:47,898
This will serve nicely
as a bill of sale.

90
00:11:00,244 --> 00:11:01,245
Whoa.

91
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:08,878
Now, as to you poor devils.

92
00:11:09,045 --> 00:11:14,091
So, as I see it, when it comes to
the subject of what to do next,

93
00:11:14,258 --> 00:11:17,094
you gentlemen have two choices.

94
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:22,391
Once I'm gone, you could lift
that beast off the remaining Speck,

95
00:11:22,558 --> 00:11:24,477
then carry him to the nearest town.

96
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:28,230
Which would be at least
37 miles back the way you came.

97
00:11:28,397 --> 00:11:34,070
You could unshackle yourselves,
take that rifle,

98
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,781
put a bullet in his head,
bury the two of them deep,

99
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:40,493
and then make your way to a
more enlightened area of this country.

100
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:42,745
Choice is yours.

101
00:11:42,912 --> 00:11:47,291
Oh, and on the off chance there are
any astronomy aficionados amongst you,

102
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:50,461
the North Star is that one.

103
00:11:51,921 --> 00:11:55,091
Ta-ta.

104
00:12:09,897 --> 00:12:13,984
Now wait a minute, fellas.
Let's talk about this!

105
00:12:17,613 --> 00:12:21,033
You gotta be reasonable
in a situation like this!

106
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,496
I'm not a bad guy.
I'm just doin' my job!

107
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:29,250
Blueberry, didn't I
give you my last apple?

108
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,378
Tell you what, boys:
Take me to the doc in El Paso,

109
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,588
I'll get you your freedom.

110
00:12:34,755 --> 00:12:38,509
No. No, please...

111
00:13:23,846 --> 00:13:25,222
All right, now.

112
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:27,391
I'd like you to
take two of these tonight...

113
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:29,768
...and then in the morning...

114
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,689
That's a nigger on a horse.

115
00:13:59,298 --> 00:14:01,091
What's everybody staring at?

116
00:14:01,258 --> 00:14:03,761
They ain't never seen
no nigger on a horse before.

117
00:14:16,065 --> 00:14:17,066
Whoa.

118
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,119
Good morning, innkeeper!

119
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,915
Two beers for two weary travelers.

120
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:34,833
It's still a bit early.

121
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,419
We won't be open for another hour.

122
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,421
By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.

123
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:45,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... what
the hell you think you're doing, boy?

124
00:14:45,177 --> 00:14:47,263
Get that nigger outta here!

125
00:14:50,808 --> 00:14:54,812
- Help! Help!
- Innkeeper!

126
00:14:54,979 --> 00:14:58,148
Remember, get the sheriff,
not the marshal.

127
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,192
Sheriff! Help!

128
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:01,986
Alas.

129
00:15:03,362 --> 00:15:05,906
Now we must act as our own bartender.

130
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,077
Sit down, my boy.

131
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,631
What kind of dentist are you?

132
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:28,053
Despite that cart, I haven't
practiced dentistry in five years.

133
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:35,978
But these days,
I practice a new profession...

134
00:15:38,188 --> 00:15:39,565
...bounty hunter.

135
00:15:46,155 --> 00:15:47,990
Do you know what a bounty hunter is?

136
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:49,742
No.

137
00:15:49,908 --> 00:15:51,118
Well...

138
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:56,874
...the way the slave trade
deals in human lives for cash,

139
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:59,376
a bounty hunter deals in corpses.

140
00:15:59,543 --> 00:16:01,754
Hat

141
00:16:05,507 --> 00:16:07,051
Prost.

142
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:17,895
The state places a bounty
on a man's head.

143
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:20,731
I track that man, I find that man,
I kill that man.

144
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:24,860
After I've killed him, I transport that
man's corpse back to the authorities.

145
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,738
Sometimes that's easier said than done.

146
00:16:27,905 --> 00:16:30,699
I show that corpse to the authorities,
proving yes, indeed,

147
00:16:30,866 --> 00:16:32,576
I truly have killed him,

148
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,746
at which point the authorities
pay me the bounty.

149
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,249
So, like slavery,
it's a flesh for cash business.

150
00:16:40,876 --> 00:16:41,877
What's a bounty?

151
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:47,132
It's like a reward.

152
00:16:47,299 --> 00:16:50,678
You kill people?
And they give you a reward?

153
00:16:50,844 --> 00:16:52,721
Certain people, yeah.

154
00:16:52,888 --> 00:16:54,014
Bad people?

155
00:16:54,181 --> 00:16:58,143
Ah! Badder they are,
bigger the reward.

156
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,604
Which brings me to you.

157
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:05,025
And I must admit, I'm at a bit of
a quandary when it comes to you.

158
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,611
On one hand, I despise slavery.

159
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,906
On the other hand, I need your help.

160
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,451
If you're not in a position to refuse,
all the better.

161
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,996
So, for the time being, I'm gonna
make this slavery malarkey

162
00:17:18,163 --> 00:17:20,374
work to my benefit.

163
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:25,212
Still, having said that, I feel guilty.

164
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:32,136
So, I would like the two of us
to enter into an agreement.

165
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,019
I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.

166
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:47,025
However, at this endeavor,

167
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:52,322
I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar
as I don't know what they look like.

168
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:56,452
But you do. Don't ya?

169
00:17:56,618 --> 00:17:58,829
I know what they look like all right.

170
00:17:58,996 --> 00:18:02,499
Good. So here's my agreement.

171
00:18:02,666 --> 00:18:06,086
- You travel with me until we find them.
- Where we goin'?

172
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:08,881
I hear at least two of them
are overseeing up in Gatlinburg,

173
00:18:09,047 --> 00:18:11,216
but I don't know where.

174
00:18:11,383 --> 00:18:15,679
That means we visit every plantation
in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.

175
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:21,101
And when we find them,
you point them out, and I kill them.

176
00:18:22,144 --> 00:18:25,522
You do that, I agree
to give you your freedom,

177
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:29,818
$25 per Brittle Brother. That's $75.

178
00:18:29,985 --> 00:18:33,697
And, as if on cue,
here comes the sheriff.

179
00:18:41,455 --> 00:18:46,960
OK, boys. Fun's over. Come on out.

180
00:18:49,588 --> 00:18:54,176
All right, folks, calm down.

181
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:56,929
Go about your business.

182
00:18:57,721 --> 00:19:00,098
These jokers will be gone soon.

183
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:07,481
Now, why y'all wanna come
into my town and start trouble?

184
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:10,901
And scare all these nice people.

185
00:19:12,069 --> 00:19:14,738
You ain't got nothing better to do

186
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:18,116
than to come into Bill Sharp's town

187
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:20,536
and show your ass?

188
00:19:28,877 --> 00:19:32,798
What'd you just do to our sheriff?

189
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,436
Now you can get the marshal.

190
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:50,274
Marshal! Marshal!

191
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,693
- Should we wait inside?
- Can we just leave?

192
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:54,069
After you.

193
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,742
Move that buckboard a long ways
across the street from the saloon.

194
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:03,787
I want six men, six rifles behind it.

195
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:06,123
I want two men,
two rifles up on this roof.

196
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,625
Two men, two rifles on that roof.

197
00:20:08,792 --> 00:20:11,753
All the barrels aimed
at that front door.

198
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,923
Somebody get poor Bill
outta the goddamn street.

199
00:20:16,091 --> 00:20:18,260
You in the saloon!

200
00:20:18,427 --> 00:20:21,763
We got a hundred rifles aimed
at every way out of that buildin'.

201
00:20:22,472 --> 00:20:25,642
You got one chance
to get out of this alive.

202
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,979
You and your nigger come out right now
with your hands over your head,

203
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,106
and I mean right now.

204
00:20:32,232 --> 00:20:35,652
Is this the marshal
I have the pleasure of addressing?

205
00:20:35,819 --> 00:20:37,613
Yes, it is.

206
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:39,865
This is U.S. Marshal Gill Tatum.

207
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,326
Na wunderbar, marshal.

208
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:46,413
I have relieved myself of all weapons,

209
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:49,499
and just as you have instructed,

210
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:52,336
I am ready to step outside

211
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:56,590
with my hands raised above my head.

212
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,093
I trust as a representative

213
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,639
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America,

214
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:09,645
I shan't be shot down in the street
by either you or your deputies

215
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:12,648
before I've had my day in court.

216
00:21:12,814 --> 00:21:15,150
You mean like you did our sheriff.

217
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,110
Shot him down like a dog in the street.

218
00:21:17,277 --> 00:21:19,613
Yes, that's exactly what I mean.

219
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:25,452
Do I have your word as a lawman not to
shoot me down like a dog in the street?

220
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:32,042
Well, much as we'd all enjoy
seeing something like that,

221
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:35,212
ain't nobody gonna cheat
the hangman in my town.

222
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:39,216
Fair enough, marshal.
Here we come.

223
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:43,220
They're a little tense out there.

224
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:46,848
So don't make any quick movements,
and let me do the talking.

225
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,851
Come ahead.

226
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,151
You unarmed?

227
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:00,028
Yes, indeed we are.

228
00:22:00,779 --> 00:22:04,116
Marshal Tatum, may I address you
and your deputies,

229
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,243
and apparently the
entire town of Daughtrey,

230
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,745
as to the incident that just occurred?

231
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,541
- Go on.
- Thank you.

232
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,835
My name is Dr. King Schultz.

233
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:18,255
Like yourself, marshal,
I'm a servant of the court.

234
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:21,842
The man lying dead in the dirt,
who the good people of Daughtrey

235
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:26,096
saw fit to elect as their sheriff,
who went by the name of Bill Sharp,

236
00:22:26,263 --> 00:22:30,851
is actually a wanted outlaw
by the name of Willard Peck,

237
00:22:31,018 --> 00:22:33,603
with a price on his head of $200.

238
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:36,732
Now that's $200, dead or alive.

239
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:38,233
The hell, you say!

240
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,446
I'm aware this is probably
disconcerting news.

241
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:45,782
But I'm willing to wager
this man was elected sheriff

242
00:22:45,949 --> 00:22:48,452
sometime in the past two years?

243
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:50,370
Yeah.

244
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:53,957
I know this because three
years ago, he was rustling cattle

245
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,586
from the B.C. Corrigan Cattle Company
of Lubbock, Texas.

246
00:22:57,753 --> 00:23:01,548
Now, this is a warrant
made out by

247
00:23:01,715 --> 00:23:07,387
Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen
Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.

248
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:09,264
You're encouraged to wire him.

249
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:14,478
He'll back up who I am and
who your dear departed sheriff was.

250
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:26,573
In other words, marshal,
you owe me $200.

251
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:36,750
I'll be damned.

252
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,365
After this Brittle business
is behind us,

253
00:24:08,532 --> 00:24:14,079
you'll be a free man, with a horse,
$75 in your back pocket...

254
00:24:16,873 --> 00:24:18,291
What's your plan after that?

255
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:24,381
Find my wife, and buy her freedom.

256
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:31,513
Django, I had no idea
you were a married man.

257
00:24:32,013 --> 00:24:34,307
Do most slaves believe in marriage?

258
00:24:34,474 --> 00:24:38,061
Oh, me and my wife do.

259
00:24:38,228 --> 00:24:42,399
Old Man Carrucan didn't.
That's why we, uh... we run off.

260
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,235
Django.

261
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:48,488
Django, Django-

262
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:51,366
You got sand, Django.

263
00:24:52,075 --> 00:24:53,952
Boy's got sand.

264
00:24:55,745 --> 00:24:58,874
I got no use for a nigger with sand.

265
00:25:00,584 --> 00:25:04,087
I want you to burn a runaway "r"
right here on his cheek.

266
00:25:04,254 --> 00:25:05,297
And the girl, too.

267
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:12,220
And I want you to take 'em to
the Greenville auction and sell 'em.

268
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,931
Both of 'em.

269
00:25:15,098 --> 00:25:16,850
Separately.

270
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,645
And this one...

271
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,984
...you will sell him cheap.

272
00:25:27,944 --> 00:25:29,446
In Greenville...

273
00:25:31,990 --> 00:25:34,951
...there should be some sort
of a records office.

274
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,377
You know when she was sold...

275
00:25:45,837 --> 00:25:48,798
...you know where she came from,

276
00:25:48,965 --> 00:25:50,800
and you know her name.

277
00:25:51,593 --> 00:25:53,136
What is her name?

278
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,971
Broomhilda.

279
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:59,809
- What?
- Broom-hilda.

280
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:01,937
- Broomhilda?
- Hm-mm.

281
00:26:04,022 --> 00:26:07,025
- Were her owners German?
- Yeah, how you know?

282
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,319
She wasn't born on
the Carrucan plantation.

283
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:12,030
She was raised by a German mistress,
the Von Shafts.

284
00:26:12,197 --> 00:26:14,324
She speak a little German, too.

285
00:26:14,491 --> 00:26:16,243
- Your wife?
- Hm-mm.

286
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,245
When she was little, her mistress
taught her so she'd have somebody

287
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:19,996
to speak German with.

288
00:26:21,581 --> 00:26:24,167
Well, let me get this straight.

289
00:26:24,334 --> 00:26:28,922
Your slave wife speaks German
and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?

290
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,215
Yep.

291
00:26:34,261 --> 00:26:37,013
They call me Hildi.

292
00:26:53,697 --> 00:26:59,286
When we gain access to these
plantations, we'll be putting on an act.

293
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:03,373
You'll be playing a character.

294
00:27:10,255 --> 00:27:11,381
Hm?

295
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:13,508
No?

296
00:27:20,515 --> 00:27:24,978
During the act, you can
never break character.

297
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:27,605
Do you understand?

298
00:27:28,356 --> 00:27:30,900
Yeah. Don't break character.

299
00:27:33,236 --> 00:27:37,157
And your character
is that of The Valet.

300
00:27:37,907 --> 00:27:39,409
What that is?

301
00:27:40,327 --> 00:27:42,704
That's a fancy word for servant.

302
00:27:42,871 --> 00:27:44,122
- Valet?
- Hm-mm.

303
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:50,128
And now, Django, you may choose
your character's costume.

304
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:54,382
Youse gonna let me
pick out my own clothes?

305
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:55,508
But of course.

306
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:25,497
Whoa.

307
00:28:29,793 --> 00:28:33,380
It's against the law for niggers
to ride horses in this territory.

308
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,925
This is my valet.
My valet does not walk.

309
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:40,970
- I said niggers on horses...
- His name is Django.

310
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:43,932
He's a free man.
He can ride what he pleases.

311
00:28:44,099 --> 00:28:47,560
Not on my property.
Not around my niggers, he can't.

312
00:28:48,228 --> 00:28:53,233
My good sir,
perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.

313
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,860
Allow me to unring this bell.

314
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:59,864
My name is Dr. King Schultz.
This is my valet, Django.

315
00:29:00,031 --> 00:29:02,158
And these are our horses,
Tony and Fritz.

316
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:07,372
Mr. Bennett?

317
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:11,751
I've been led to believe that you
are a gentleman and a businessman.

318
00:29:11,918 --> 00:29:15,880
And it is for these attributes
we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee

319
00:29:16,047 --> 00:29:17,966
to parley with you now.

320
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:23,096
I wish to purchase
one of your nigger gals.

321
00:29:24,639 --> 00:29:27,725
You and your Jimmie
rode from Texas to Tennessee

322
00:29:27,892 --> 00:29:29,686
to buy one of my nigger gals?

323
00:29:29,853 --> 00:29:31,521
No appointment, no nothin'?

324
00:29:31,688 --> 00:29:33,606
Oh, I'm afraid so.

325
00:29:33,773 --> 00:29:36,192
Well, what if I was to say
I don't like you?

326
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:38,027
Or your fancy-pants nigger?

327
00:29:38,194 --> 00:29:40,405
And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.

328
00:29:40,572 --> 00:29:42,532
Now what you got to say about that?

329
00:29:45,869 --> 00:29:47,787
Mr. Bennett.

330
00:29:47,954 --> 00:29:51,207
If you are the businessman
I've been led to believe you to be,

331
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:56,546
I have 5,000 things I might say
that could change your mind.

332
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:04,220
Well, come on inside and get
yourself somethin' cool to drink.

333
00:30:06,222 --> 00:30:07,307
Hm-mm.

334
00:30:18,735 --> 00:30:20,695
Oh, maybe while we discuss business,

335
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:23,406
you could provide one of
your loveliest black creatures

336
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:25,950
to escort Django here
around your magnificent grounds.

337
00:30:26,117 --> 00:30:28,286
Oh, well, absolutely!
Uh, Betina.

338
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:30,205
- Yessir, Big Daddy?
- Uh...

339
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:32,248
What's your Jimmie's name again?

340
00:30:32,415 --> 00:30:33,917
'Django.
'Django.

341
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,252
Betina, sugar, could you
take Django there

342
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:39,631
and take him around the grounds here
and show him all the pretty stuff.

343
00:30:39,797 --> 00:30:41,090
As you please, Big Daddy.

344
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:45,178
Oh, Mr. Bennett, I must remind you,
Django is a free man.

345
00:30:45,345 --> 00:30:48,681
He cannot be treated like a slave.
He... within the bounds of good taste,

346
00:30:48,848 --> 00:30:51,351
he must be treated
as an extension of myself.

347
00:30:51,518 --> 00:30:54,521
- Understood, Schultz. Betina, sugar?
- Yes'm?

348
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:59,317
Django isn't a slave.
Django is a free man, you understand?

349
00:31:00,652 --> 00:31:02,820
You can't treat him like any
of the other niggers around here,

350
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:05,907
'cause he ain't like any of the
other niggers around here. You got it?

351
00:31:06,074 --> 00:31:08,952
You want I should
treat him like white folks?

352
00:31:09,118 --> 00:31:12,247
No. That's not what I said.

353
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,958
Then I don't know what you want,
Big Daddy.

354
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:19,963
Yes, I can see that. Uh...

355
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:24,592
What's the name of that peckerwood boy
from town that works with the glass?

356
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,719
His mama work over at the lumberyard.

357
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:29,639
- Oh, you mean Jerry.
- That's the boy's name. Jerry!

358
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,307
You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?

359
00:31:31,474 --> 00:31:34,602
- Yes'm, Big Daddy.
- Well, that's it, then.

360
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:37,730
You just treat him like you would Jerry.

361
00:31:44,696 --> 00:31:47,407
That house we just left from
is The Big House.

362
00:31:47,574 --> 00:31:50,493
Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.

363
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:53,830
That there is the pantry.

364
00:31:53,997 --> 00:31:57,500
That's where Big Daddy
hang all his dead meat.

365
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,711
Po' little squirrels.

366
00:32:01,421 --> 00:32:03,840
What you do for your massa?

367
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:05,758
Didn't you hear him tell you
I ain't no slave?

368
00:32:05,925 --> 00:32:08,344
- So you really free?
- Yes, I's free.

369
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:10,847
You mean you wanna dress like that?

370
00:32:12,682 --> 00:32:15,143
- Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.
- What you want?

371
00:32:15,310 --> 00:32:18,396
I'm lookin' for three white men.
Three brothers. Overseers.

372
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:20,023
Their name is Brittle. You know 'em?

373
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:22,066
- Brittle?
- Yes, Brittle.

374
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:26,529
John Brittle, Ellis Brittle,
Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.

375
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:28,531
I don't know them.

376
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:30,950
They could be usin' a different name.

377
00:32:31,117 --> 00:32:33,369
They woulda come to the plantation
this past year.

378
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,164
- You mean the Shaffers?
- Maybe.

379
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:38,458
- Three brothers?
- Uh-huh.

380
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,376
- They here?
- Uh-huh.

381
00:32:40,543 --> 00:32:42,295
Could you point one of 'em out to me?

382
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,756
Well, one's over in that field.

383
00:32:58,853 --> 00:33:00,438
Old Man Carrucan ain't
gonna appreciate this, now.

384
00:33:00,605 --> 00:33:01,564
She work in the house, John.

385
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:03,608
You could mess her skin up,
and you gonna mess her up

386
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,735
and she ain't gonna be worth...
she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.

387
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:07,779
Now, your Bible say...

388
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,535
Look, I told you
that I was one that made her do it.

389
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:16,329
You ready?

390
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:18,790
She didn't wanna run off with me. If
anybody should be gettin' whupped now,

391
00:33:18,956 --> 00:33:20,333
it should be me. It should be me, John.

392
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:23,461
Now, I been here long enough, you know
me, you know me a long time, now.

393
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:35,181
You know Massa Carrucan
ain't gonna appreciate this.

394
00:33:35,348 --> 00:33:36,974
She's a... she's a house slave.

395
00:33:37,141 --> 00:33:40,561
She a house slave, she can't be...

396
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,417
On my knees. I'm asking you this,
please. Ain't this what you want?

397
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,460
I'm keeping it funny for you.
Now, John, please.

398
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:11,551
L's on my knees, John.

399
00:34:11,718 --> 00:34:13,678
I like the way you beg, boy.

400
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,976
Is that who you was lookin' for?

401
00:34:21,811 --> 00:34:22,979
Yep.

402
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,565
Where the other two at?

403
00:34:25,732 --> 00:34:29,485
They by the stable,
punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.

404
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,320
They whippin' Little Jody?

405
00:34:31,946 --> 00:34:33,823
Point me in that direction.

406
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:37,535
You go to that tree
and keep goin' that-a way.

407
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:44,250
Go get that white man
I came here with.

408
00:34:45,877 --> 00:34:47,170
- Come on, now.
- No, no, please!

409
00:34:47,336 --> 00:34:48,838
- Come on, girlie.
- Please!

410
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:51,549
Come on. Get you set up now.

411
00:34:51,716 --> 00:34:54,177
"And the Lord said,
'The fear of ye..."

412
00:34:54,343 --> 00:34:57,305
"...and the dread of ye

413
00:34:57,472 --> 00:34:59,766
shall be on every beast
of the earth."'

414
00:35:01,058 --> 00:35:02,435
Come here now, woman!

415
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:05,688
You'd better give me that arm!

416
00:35:22,872 --> 00:35:24,624
OK, she's ready!

417
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:42,725
And after this, we'll see
if you break eggs again.

418
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:48,064
John Brittle!

419
00:36:08,626 --> 00:36:11,295
You remember me?

420
00:36:22,223 --> 00:36:24,600
I like the way you die, boy.

421
00:36:30,356 --> 00:36:32,900
Goddamn son of a bitch!

422
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,420
Keep it funny!

423
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:19,447
Y'all wanna see somethin'?

424
00:37:22,950 --> 00:37:24,619
No!

425
00:37:34,754 --> 00:37:36,297
Who were they?

426
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:40,009
That's Big John,
and that's Lil Raj.

427
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:41,677
Where's Ellis?

428
00:37:41,844 --> 00:37:44,180
He's the one hightailin' it
across that field right now.

429
00:37:49,018 --> 00:37:50,519
- You sure that's him?
- Yeah.

430
00:37:50,686 --> 00:37:52,605
- Positive?
- I don't know.

431
00:37:52,772 --> 00:37:55,024
- You don't know if you're positive?
- I don't know what "positive" mean.

432
00:37:55,191 --> 00:37:56,442
- It means you're sure.
- Yes.

433
00:37:56,609 --> 00:37:58,903
- "Yes," what?
- Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.

434
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:13,709
I'm positive he dead.

435
00:38:18,756 --> 00:38:19,757
Django!

436
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:23,970
Everybody calm down.

437
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:26,389
We mean no one else any harm.

438
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,099
Who are you two jokers?

439
00:38:28,265 --> 00:38:31,268
I am Dr. King Schultz,
a legal representative

440
00:38:31,435 --> 00:38:34,105
of the criminal justice system of
the United States of America.

441
00:38:34,271 --> 00:38:38,859
The man to my left is Django Freeman.
He's my deputy.

442
00:38:39,026 --> 00:38:40,987
In my pocket is a warrant,

443
00:38:41,153 --> 00:38:45,241
signed by Circuit Court Judge
Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas,

444
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:49,286
for the arrest and capture,
dead or alive,

445
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:54,458
of John Brittle,
Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.

446
00:38:54,625 --> 00:38:56,711
They were goin' by the name Shaffer.

447
00:38:58,129 --> 00:39:02,258
You know them by the name of Shaffer,
but the butchers' real name was Brittle.

448
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:04,093
These are wanted men.

449
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:05,720
The law wants 'em for murder.

450
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:10,016
Now, I reiterate, the warrant
states dead or alive,

451
00:39:10,182 --> 00:39:13,477
so when Mr. Freeman and myself
executed these men on sight,

452
00:39:13,644 --> 00:39:17,106
we were operating
within our legal boundaries.

453
00:39:18,232 --> 00:39:22,611
I realize passions are high,

454
00:39:22,778 --> 00:39:26,824
but I must warn you,
the penalty for taking deadly force

455
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,368
against an officer of the court
in the performance of his duty

456
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:33,456
is you'll be hung by the neck
until you're dead.

457
00:39:36,333 --> 00:39:41,213
Now, may I please remove the warrant
from my pocket so you may examine it?

458
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:44,425
Gimme.

459
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,318
Satisfied?

460
00:40:08,824 --> 00:40:11,118
May I have that back, please?

461
00:40:16,832 --> 00:40:19,835
- Get off my land.
- Posthaste.

462
00:40:20,503 --> 00:40:24,924
Load up the bodies as quickly as you can
and let's get outta here.

463
00:40:50,783 --> 00:40:54,286
Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.

464
00:41:34,326 --> 00:41:35,578
Come on, men!

465
00:41:37,788 --> 00:41:41,292
- We're coming for you, nigger!
- Hee-haw!

466
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:54,930
Now, unless they start shootin' first,
nobody shoot 'em.

467
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:57,308
That's way too simple for these jokers.

468
00:41:58,058 --> 00:42:00,686
We're gonna whup that
nigger-lover to death.

469
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:05,900
And I'm gonna personally
strip and clip that garboon myself.

470
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:10,988
Damn.

471
00:42:12,323 --> 00:42:14,950
I can't see fuckin' shit
outta this thing.

472
00:42:15,868 --> 00:42:17,161
We ready or what?

473
00:42:17,328 --> 00:42:19,705
Aw, hold on,
I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.

474
00:42:19,872 --> 00:42:22,249
Oh... Oh, shit.

475
00:42:22,416 --> 00:42:24,627
I just made it worse.

476
00:42:24,793 --> 00:42:26,837
Who made this goddamn shit?

477
00:42:27,004 --> 00:42:29,965
- Willard's wife.
- Well, make your own goddamn masks!

478
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:33,719
Look, nobody's sayin'
they don't appreciate what Jenny did.

479
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:36,472
Well, if all I had to do
was cut a hole in a bag,

480
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:38,307
I coulda cut it better than this!

481
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,268
What about you, Robert?
Can you see?

482
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:42,645
Not too good.

483
00:42:42,811 --> 00:42:47,149
I mean, if I don't move my head I can
see you pretty good, more or less.

484
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:50,819
But when I start ridin', the bag's
movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.

485
00:42:50,986 --> 00:42:53,072
- Shit.
- Yeah.

486
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,282
I just made mine worse.

487
00:42:56,116 --> 00:42:57,243
Oh, God.

488
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:58,953
Anybody bring any extra bags?

489
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,081
No, nobody brought an extra bag!

490
00:43:02,248 --> 00:43:03,874
I'm just askin'.

491
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:05,834
Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?

492
00:43:06,001 --> 00:43:07,211
Oh, well, shitfire!

493
00:43:07,378 --> 00:43:10,464
If you don't wear 'em as you ride up,
that just defeats the purpose!

494
00:43:10,631 --> 00:43:12,591
Well, I can't see
in this fuckin' thing!

495
00:43:12,758 --> 00:43:15,469
I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing
and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!

496
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:18,055
Well, fuck all y'all! I'm goin' home!

497
00:43:18,222 --> 00:43:22,017
Now, I watched my wife work all day
gettin' 30 bags together

498
00:43:22,184 --> 00:43:24,186
for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches,

499
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,107
and all I can hear is
criticize, criticize, criticize!

500
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,443
From now on, don't ask me
or mine for nothin'!

501
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:35,614
Now, look, let's not forget
why we're here.

502
00:43:35,781 --> 00:43:38,867
We got a killer nigger
over that hill there!

503
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,369
And we gotta make a lesson out of him.

504
00:43:40,536 --> 00:43:44,373
OK, I'm confused.
Are the bags on or off?

505
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,336
I think we all think
the bag was a nice idea.

506
00:43:49,503 --> 00:43:50,462
Yeah.

507
00:43:50,629 --> 00:43:54,717
But, not pointin' any fingers,
they coulda been done better.

508
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:59,388
So how 'bout no bags this time,

509
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:04,560
but next time we do the bags right
and then we go full regalia.

510
00:44:04,727 --> 00:44:06,729
- I like that idea a lot.
- You get my vote, Robert.

511
00:44:06,895 --> 00:44:10,232
Wait a minute!
I didn't say no bags.

512
00:44:10,399 --> 00:44:12,401
But nobody can see.

513
00:44:12,568 --> 00:44:13,652
So?

514
00:44:13,819 --> 00:44:15,696
So it'd be nice to see.

515
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:20,617
Goddamn it! This is a raid!
I can't see, you can't see!

516
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:26,165
So what? All that matters is can
the fuckin' horse see! That's a raid!

517
00:44:26,332 --> 00:44:29,126
Sons of bitches!

518
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,628
I can't see shit!

519
00:44:31,795 --> 00:44:35,424
There he is! Get that nigger
out from under that wagon!

520
00:44:36,258 --> 00:44:38,260
And get that nigger-lover
outta the wagon!

521
00:44:38,427 --> 00:44:40,054
That nigger ain't down here,
Big Daddy!

522
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,638
- What?
- They tricked us!

523
00:44:41,805 --> 00:44:42,848
Well, where are they?

524
00:44:43,015 --> 00:44:44,433
Auf Wiedersehen.

525
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:51,940
Oh!

526
00:44:52,107 --> 00:44:53,150
Bull's-eye.

527
00:44:56,153 --> 00:44:59,448
Look at 'em run.

528
00:45:02,076 --> 00:45:04,661
Yeah, cowards tend to do that.

529
00:45:04,828 --> 00:45:06,789
Goddamn it!

530
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,171
Goddamn it!

531
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:20,511
Would you care to?

532
00:45:27,309 --> 00:45:29,144
Can't see shit outta this!

533
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,939
- He's getting away.
- I got him.

534
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,442
Big Daddy's getting away.

535
00:45:35,609 --> 00:45:36,860
I got him.

536
00:45:52,126 --> 00:45:53,168
Got him.

537
00:45:58,006 --> 00:46:01,009
The kid's a natural.

538
00:46:11,687 --> 00:46:15,482
How you know Broomhilda's
first masters was German?

539
00:46:15,649 --> 00:46:17,901
Broomhilda is a German name.

540
00:46:18,068 --> 00:46:20,779
If they named her,
it stands to reason they'd be German.

541
00:46:20,946 --> 00:46:23,198
Lots of gals where you're from
named Broomhilda?

542
00:46:23,991 --> 00:46:26,952
Broomhilda is the name of a character

543
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:31,039
in the most popular
of all the German legends.

544
00:46:31,206 --> 00:46:33,167
There's a story about Broomhilda?

545
00:46:33,333 --> 00:46:35,043
Oh, yes, there is.

546
00:46:41,091 --> 00:46:44,553
- Do you know it?
- Oh, every German knows that story.

547
00:46:50,976 --> 00:46:52,352
Would you like me to tell you?

548
00:46:53,854 --> 00:46:59,860
Well, Broomhilda was a princess.

549
00:47:01,695 --> 00:47:05,782
She was a daughter of Wotan,
god of all gods.

550
00:47:06,825 --> 00:47:10,037
Anyway, her father is really mad at her.

551
00:47:10,204 --> 00:47:11,455
What she do?

552
00:47:12,414 --> 00:47:13,874
I can't exactly remember.

553
00:47:14,041 --> 00:47:16,710
She disobeys him in some way.

554
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:20,047
So he puts her on top of the mountain.

555
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:21,840
Broomhilda's on a mountain?

556
00:47:22,007 --> 00:47:23,258
It's a German legend,

557
00:47:23,425 --> 00:47:26,220
there's always going to be
a mountain in there somewhere.

558
00:47:26,386 --> 00:47:30,432
And he puts a fire-breathing dragon
there to guard the mountain.

559
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,189
And he surrounds her
in a circle of hellfire.

560
00:47:38,649 --> 00:47:42,986
And there, Broomhilda shall remain.

561
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:49,576
Unless a hero arises
brave enough to save her.

562
00:47:50,661 --> 00:47:52,246
Does a fella arise?

563
00:47:52,412 --> 00:47:55,374
Yes, Django, as a matter of fact,
he does.

564
00:47:55,541 --> 00:47:57,584
A fella named Siegfried.

565
00:47:58,293 --> 00:47:59,294
Does Siegfried save her?

566
00:48:01,463 --> 00:48:04,091
Quite spectacularly so.

567
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:09,263
He scales the mountain,
because he's not afraid of it.

568
00:48:09,972 --> 00:48:14,142
He slays the dragon,
because he's not afraid of him.

569
00:48:14,309 --> 00:48:16,812
And he walks through hellfire...

570
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:21,525
...because Broomhilda's worth it.

571
00:48:25,654 --> 00:48:27,322
I know how he feel.

572
00:48:28,782 --> 00:48:31,660
I think I'm just
starting to realize that.

573
00:48:37,165 --> 00:48:41,336
Now, look, Django...

574
00:48:44,256 --> 00:48:48,302
...I don't doubt that one day
you'll save your lady love...

575
00:48:49,428 --> 00:48:53,015
...but I can't let you go to
Greenville in a good conscience.

576
00:48:54,057 --> 00:48:58,520
A slave auction town in Mississippi
isn't the place for you to visit.

577
00:48:58,687 --> 00:49:01,565
Free or not, it's just too dangerous.

578
00:49:04,526 --> 00:49:06,695
But let me ask you a question.

579
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:16,622
How do you like the
bounty hunting business?

580
00:49:18,123 --> 00:49:20,459
Kill white folks
and they pay you for it?

581
00:49:21,293 --> 00:49:22,628
What's not to like?

582
00:49:22,794 --> 00:49:25,213
Now, I have to admit,
we make a good team.

583
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:28,216
I thought you was mad at me
for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.

584
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:30,469
Yeah, on that occasion
you were a tad overzealous,

585
00:49:30,636 --> 00:49:32,596
but normally, that's a good thing.

586
00:49:33,388 --> 00:49:35,599
How'd you like to partner up
for the winter?

587
00:49:35,766 --> 00:49:37,768
What you mean "partner up"?

588
00:49:37,934 --> 00:49:42,230
You work with me through the winter
till the snow melts...

589
00:49:43,231 --> 00:49:45,233
...I give you a third of my bounties.

590
00:49:46,443 --> 00:49:50,364
So we make some money this winter,
and when the snow melts,

591
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:53,450
I'll take you to Greenville myself

592
00:49:53,617 --> 00:49:56,828
and we'll find
where they sent your wife.

593
00:50:01,083 --> 00:50:02,834
Why you care what happen to me?

594
00:50:04,586 --> 00:50:06,546
Why you care if I find my wife?

595
00:50:06,713 --> 00:50:08,090
Frankly...

596
00:50:09,383 --> 00:50:12,260
...I've never given anybody
their freedom before.

597
00:50:12,427 --> 00:50:16,264
And now that I have,
I feel vaguely responsible for you.

598
00:50:17,516 --> 00:50:21,228
Plus, when a German meets a real life
Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.

599
00:50:23,772 --> 00:50:26,650
As a German, I'm obliged
to help you on your quest

600
00:50:26,817 --> 00:50:29,444
to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.

601
00:52:38,740 --> 00:52:39,741
You got her.

602
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:51,461
Ooh. What happened to Mr. "I Wanna
Shoot White Folks For Money"?

603
00:52:51,628 --> 00:52:54,339
- His son's with him.
- Well, good.

604
00:52:54,506 --> 00:52:56,091
He'll have a loved one with him.

605
00:52:56,258 --> 00:52:58,760
Maybe even share a last word.

606
00:53:00,762 --> 00:53:02,806
That's better than most of them get.

607
00:53:02,973 --> 00:53:05,267
Damn sight better than he deserves.

608
00:53:13,441 --> 00:53:14,776
Put down the rifle.

609
00:53:17,779 --> 00:53:19,489
Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.

610
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:22,617
Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.

611
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:28,081
Read it aloud.

612
00:53:28,957 --> 00:53:30,750
Consider that today's lesson.

613
00:53:33,169 --> 00:53:35,839
"Wanted. Dead or alive.

00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:29,517
If Smitty Bacall wanted
to start a farm at 22,

630
00:54:29,684 --> 00:54:31,645
they would never have printed that.

631
00:54:32,354 --> 00:54:35,774
But Smitty Bacall
wanted to rob stagecoaches

632
00:54:35,941 --> 00:54:38,360
and he didn't mind
killing people to do it.

633
00:54:39,027 --> 00:54:42,364
Do you want to save your wife
by doing what I do?

634
00:54:43,615 --> 00:54:45,075
This is what I do.

635
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:48,787
I kill people and
sell their corpses for cash.

636
00:54:49,704 --> 00:54:53,500
This corpse is worth $7,000.

637
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:55,877
Now quit your pussyfooting
and shoot him.

638
00:55:06,012 --> 00:55:07,389
Pa?

639
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:08,890
Pa!

640
00:55:17,357 --> 00:55:19,067
Here.

641
00:55:19,234 --> 00:55:21,319
You need to keep this
Smitty Bacall handbill.

642
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:23,571
- Why?
- It's good luck.

643
00:55:23,738 --> 00:55:26,533
You always keep the handbill
of your first bounty.

644
00:56:14,456 --> 00:56:15,874
That's accurate.

645
00:57:24,192 --> 00:57:27,320
Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?

646
00:57:28,363 --> 00:57:30,532
Who the hell-a you got there?

647
00:57:30,698 --> 00:57:32,659
The Wilson-Lowe Gang.

648
00:57:32,826 --> 00:57:35,829
Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?

649
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:41,084
Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner
Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.

650
00:57:41,251 --> 00:57:44,879
Huh. Well, just leave 'em out here,
they ain't going nowhere.

651
00:57:45,046 --> 00:57:47,423
Why don't you come in then
out of the snowy snow

652
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:49,425
and get yourselves some coffee.

653
00:57:49,592 --> 00:57:52,137
We had a birthday yesterday.
Got some cake.

654
00:57:52,303 --> 00:57:53,721
Pretty good.

655
00:58:15,869 --> 00:58:18,204
Move along!

656
00:58:23,543 --> 00:58:25,628
Move it, boy!

657
00:58:27,172 --> 00:58:28,423
Keep movin'.

658
00:58:28,590 --> 00:58:30,550
Get on up on that auction block.

659
00:58:32,093 --> 00:58:34,470
Don't let that mud slow you down.
Keep going.

660
00:58:50,904 --> 00:58:52,155
Keep goin'!

661
00:58:54,616 --> 00:58:58,536
"Broomhilda Von Shaft. Age 27.

662
00:58:58,703 --> 00:59:00,121
'R' on right cheek."

663
00:59:01,789 --> 00:59:04,042
Calvin Candie.

664
00:59:04,209 --> 00:59:08,630
He owns the fourth biggest cotton
- Candyland.

665
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:10,131
Candyland?

666
00:59:10,298 --> 00:59:11,382
Oh, so you've heard of it.

667
00:59:11,549 --> 00:59:13,635
Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.

668
00:59:13,801 --> 00:59:16,471
Well, apparently,
that's where your wife is...

669
00:59:16,638 --> 00:59:18,306
...and that's the repellant gentleman

670
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:22,018
who owns her. Let's just hope she
works in the house, not in the field.

671
00:59:22,185 --> 00:59:24,312
Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.

672
00:59:24,479 --> 00:59:26,481
She... she pretty.

673
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:29,067
And she talk good, too.

674
00:59:30,652 --> 00:59:32,445
But when they tore her back up
and then they...

675
00:59:33,655 --> 00:59:35,823
...burned that runaway "r"
on her cheek...

676
00:59:37,242 --> 00:59:38,409
...they goddamned her.

677
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:44,499
She ain't no field nigger
but she ain't good enough

678
00:59:44,666 --> 00:59:46,668
for the house no more either.

679
00:59:46,834 --> 00:59:48,127
They gonna try to
make her a comfort girl.

680
00:59:48,294 --> 00:59:50,171
What's a comfort...? Oh.

681
00:59:51,089 --> 00:59:52,382
Not while I got freedom.

682
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:55,760
Not while I got my gun.

683
00:59:58,846 --> 01:00:00,556
So do we offer to buy her?

684
01:00:03,184 --> 01:00:04,560
So...

685
01:00:06,145 --> 01:00:07,814
...say...

686
01:00:09,983 --> 01:00:13,194
...a man wants to buy a horse.

687
01:00:13,361 --> 01:00:15,405
Needs to buy a horse.

688
01:00:16,364 --> 01:00:19,325
He walks up to the farmer's farm,
and he knocks on the farmer's door

689
01:00:19,492 --> 01:00:21,160
and asks the farmer to buy his horse.

690
01:00:21,327 --> 01:00:23,121
And do you know what the farmer says?

691
01:00:23,288 --> 01:00:25,498
The farmer says no.

692
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:31,963
Well, I say fuck that farmer,
and I'm stealin' that horse.

693
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:36,259
Fair enough. But now you're a horse
thief, and they hang horse thieves.

694
01:00:36,426 --> 01:00:38,553
Not to mention the horse
goes back to its original owner

695
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,346
because the horse is still his property.

696
01:00:40,513 --> 01:00:44,392
We need her and we need a bill of sale.

697
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:46,853
Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her,
then how we gonna get her?

698
01:00:47,937 --> 01:00:51,524
May I offer an alternative
plan of action?

699
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,192
Go ahead.

700
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,905
So... the man walks up
to the farmer's farm,

701
01:00:58,072 --> 01:00:59,615
he knocks on the farmer's door...

702
01:01:00,325 --> 01:01:05,371
...and asks not to buy the horse,
but the farm.

703
01:01:05,538 --> 01:01:08,916
And makes an offer so ridiculous,

704
01:01:09,083 --> 01:01:11,878
the farmer is forced to say yes.

705
01:01:12,754 --> 01:01:15,506
- We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
- No, it's far too big.

706
01:01:15,673 --> 01:01:18,926
But apparently this farmer
ain't all about the farm.

707
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,430
How much do you know
about Mandingo fighting?

708
01:01:22,597 --> 01:01:23,598
What?

709
01:01:23,765 --> 01:01:26,601
Can you convincingly
masquerade as someone

710
01:01:26,768 --> 01:01:28,436
who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?

711
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:29,645
Why?

712
01:01:29,812 --> 01:01:33,441
<i>Because my character is that</i>
<i>of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf,</i>

713
01:01:33,608 --> 01:01:37,028
<i>here in Greenville to buy my way</i>
<i>into the Mandingo fight game.</i>

714
01:01:37,195 --> 01:01:41,115
<i>And your character is a Mandingo expert</i>
<i>I hired to help me do it.</i>

715
01:01:41,282 --> 01:01:43,242
<i>They call that "One-Eyed Charley."</i>

716
01:01:46,329 --> 01:01:47,789
Bonjour.

717
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,795
We're here to see Mr. Calvin Candie.

718
01:01:53,961 --> 01:01:55,546
<i>Entraz.</i>

719
01:01:58,049 --> 01:01:59,509
- Thank you.
- Hm-mm.

720
01:02:00,551 --> 01:02:03,179
You want me to play a black slaver?

721
01:02:03,346 --> 01:02:06,015
Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.

722
01:02:06,182 --> 01:02:09,644
A black slaver is lower
than the head house nigger...

723
01:02:10,311 --> 01:02:12,438
...and, buddy,
that's pretty fuckin' low.

724
01:02:13,564 --> 01:02:15,566
Then play him that way.

725
01:02:15,733 --> 01:02:19,779
Give me your black slaver.

726
01:02:22,448 --> 01:02:27,412
<i>â™ª Along came the 219</i>
<i>Toot! Toot! Peanut butter!</i>

727
01:02:31,165 --> 01:02:33,042
Dr. Schultz!

728
01:02:33,209 --> 01:02:36,421
- Good to see you again!
- Mr. Moguy.

729
01:02:36,587 --> 01:02:39,382
Thank you for your assistance
in creating the opportunity

730
01:02:39,549 --> 01:02:42,343
- for this appointment.
- Nonsense, it's my job.

731
01:02:42,510 --> 01:02:45,346
So this is the One-Eyed Charley
I've heard so much about.

732
01:02:45,513 --> 01:02:47,932
Yes, this is Django Freeman.

733
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:50,768
Django, this is Mr. Candie's lawyer,
Leonide Moguy.

734
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:52,895
Just call me Leo.

735
01:02:53,062 --> 01:02:56,232
Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
You all wanna follow me?

736
01:02:56,399 --> 01:02:58,693
How long have you been
associated with Mr. Candie?

737
01:02:58,860 --> 01:03:01,320
Oh, Calvin's father and I
were about 11

738
01:03:01,487 --> 01:03:03,281
when we went to
boarding school together.

739
01:03:03,448 --> 01:03:06,534
Calvin's father's father
put me through law school.

740
01:03:06,701 --> 01:03:09,704
One could almost say
I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.

741
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,622
One could almost say youse a nigger.

742
01:03:12,498 --> 01:03:13,916
What did you say?

743
01:03:14,083 --> 01:03:16,836
- I said...
- Nothing, he's just being cheeky.

744
01:03:17,378 --> 01:03:21,799
Uh, anything else about Mr. Candie
that I should know before I meet him?

745
01:03:21,966 --> 01:03:23,968
Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.

746
01:03:24,135 --> 01:03:25,928
What civilized people aren't?

747
01:03:26,095 --> 01:03:28,347
And he prefers Monsieur Candie
to Mr. Candie.

748
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:35,146
He doesn't speak French. Don't speak
French to him, it'll embarrass him.

749
01:03:38,065 --> 01:03:40,318
Get back on top, now!
Turn around!

750
01:03:40,485 --> 01:03:41,986
There you go.

751
01:03:42,153 --> 01:03:43,779
There you go.

752
01:03:45,656 --> 01:03:47,909
Why do you want to get in
the Mandingo business?

753
01:03:50,745 --> 01:03:54,499
You don't intend to allow your second
to make the proper introductions?

754
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:57,126
Quit stalling, now.

755
01:03:57,293 --> 01:03:58,628
Answer the question.

756
01:04:01,297 --> 01:04:04,717
The awful truth? I'm bored.

757
01:04:04,884 --> 01:04:07,261
This seems like a good bit of fun.

758
01:04:12,183 --> 01:04:14,185
Well, come on over.

759
01:04:14,352 --> 01:04:17,063
We got us a fight goin' on
that's a good bit of fun.

760
01:04:21,108 --> 01:04:22,568
Won't you accompany me to the bar?

761
01:04:31,827 --> 01:04:33,829
You don't wear a hat in the house,
white man. Even I know that.

762
01:04:43,381 --> 01:04:44,799
- Dr. Schultz.
- What a rare pleasure.

763
01:04:44,966 --> 01:04:46,384
Keep fighting, niggers.

764
01:04:46,551 --> 01:04:49,345
- And I might add, an honor.
- Honor to meet you.

765
01:04:49,512 --> 01:04:51,430
Please have a seat,
the pleasure's all mine.

766
01:04:51,597 --> 01:04:55,101
Get free man Django here
whatever he wants.

767
01:04:55,268 --> 01:04:57,562
And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.

768
01:05:17,206 --> 01:05:20,251
Use your weight, boy,
use your weight! There you go.

769
01:05:20,418 --> 01:05:22,670
He's much bigger and stronger!

770
01:05:22,837 --> 01:05:24,422
Come on, now!

771
01:05:24,589 --> 01:05:27,091
He's not doing what I told him,
for God's sakes.

772
01:05:31,178 --> 01:05:33,973
Come on, now, boy!
It's a fight to the death!

773
01:05:34,140 --> 01:05:37,226
You either hit him or are you ain't?

774
01:05:45,234 --> 01:05:48,321
Big Fred, come on!

775
01:05:48,487 --> 01:05:50,031
Turn him around! Now...

776
01:05:53,826 --> 01:05:58,164
Use your strength, boy!
Come on, now! Use your strength!

777
01:06:00,249 --> 01:06:02,043
There you go!

778
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,838
There you go! Look at that.

779
01:06:06,922 --> 01:06:09,884
See, I told you to put
some more power in there.

780
01:06:10,051 --> 01:06:12,094
Do what I told you, boy!

781
01:06:12,261 --> 01:06:13,721
There you go!

782
01:06:13,888 --> 01:06:16,182
- No!
- Do what I told ya!

783
01:06:16,349 --> 01:06:19,393
Blind him black, boy!
Blind him black!

784
01:06:21,812 --> 01:06:24,315
Oh, no, Luigi.

785
01:06:27,526 --> 01:06:31,447
Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo!

786
01:06:32,073 --> 01:06:33,240
Oh...

787
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,086
Finish him.

788
01:06:49,382 --> 01:06:51,133
Go on, boy, finish him!

789
01:06:55,638 --> 01:06:57,348
That's why they
call him Big Fred.

790
01:06:57,515 --> 01:07:00,935
- Worth every penny.
- Well, arrivederci, Luigi.

791
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:03,312
Come on up, now, boy.
Get yourself a rest.

792
01:07:03,479 --> 01:07:06,482
You did a fine job.
A real fine job.

793
01:07:07,108 --> 01:07:08,818
Mercedes.

794
01:07:29,922 --> 01:07:31,132
Tequila.

795
01:07:41,142 --> 01:07:42,643
What's your name?

796
01:07:44,812 --> 01:07:46,313
Django.

797
01:07:48,733 --> 01:07:50,401
Can you spell it?

798
01:07:52,528 --> 01:07:56,574
D-J-A-N-G-O.

799
01:07:58,075 --> 01:07:59,577
The D is silent.

800
01:07:59,744 --> 01:08:01,328
I know.

801
01:08:09,295 --> 01:08:12,798
Mr. Moguy, want you to
take care of my new boy here.

802
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:14,675
You find him a room
with a soft bed,

803
01:08:14,842 --> 01:08:17,428
then you bring him up
a pony to lick his pole.

804
01:08:17,595 --> 01:08:20,347
But you be ready to travel to Candyland
tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?

805
01:08:20,514 --> 01:08:21,515
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

806
01:08:21,682 --> 01:08:25,561
Before you go,
Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.

807
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:32,401
You enjoy that, boy.
You've earned it.

808
01:08:32,568 --> 01:08:33,861
Yessir.

809
01:08:43,370 --> 01:08:47,166
- What's your name, boy?
- His name is Django Freeman.

810
01:08:50,711 --> 01:08:52,338
Where'd you dig him up?

811
01:08:52,505 --> 01:08:55,758
A fortuitous turn of events
brought Django and myself together.

812
01:08:57,468 --> 01:08:59,553
I've heard tell about you.

813
01:09:00,304 --> 01:09:03,057
I heard you been telling everybody
them Mandingos ain't no damn good.

814
01:09:03,224 --> 01:09:05,351
Ain't nothin' nobody
is sellin' is worth buyin'.

815
01:09:05,518 --> 01:09:09,730
I'm curious... what makes you
such a Mandingo expert?

816
01:09:11,690 --> 01:09:14,109
I'm curious what makes you so curious.

817
01:09:17,404 --> 01:09:19,490
- What did you say, boy?
- Calm down, Butch.

818
01:09:20,533 --> 01:09:21,867
No offense given...

819
01:09:22,701 --> 01:09:23,911
...none taken.

820
01:09:24,078 --> 01:09:25,788
Monsieur Candie...

821
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:29,458
...I'd appreciate if you could
direct your line of inquiry toward me.

822
01:09:29,625 --> 01:09:31,085
One...

823
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:34,839
...you do not have anything to drink.
Can I get you a tasty refreshment?

824
01:09:35,005 --> 01:09:37,842
- Yes! I'll have a beer.
- Wunderbar.

825
01:09:38,008 --> 01:09:39,844
Roscoe, a beer
for the man with the beard,

826
01:09:40,010 --> 01:09:41,846
and I will have a
Polynesian Pearl Diver.

827
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,098
Do not spare the rum.

828
01:09:44,265 --> 01:09:47,768
Doc... I am a seasoned slaver.

829
01:09:47,935 --> 01:09:49,645
You are, well, you are a neophyte.

830
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:54,942
I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this
cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.

831
01:09:56,402 --> 01:09:59,613
With all due respect, Monsieur Candie...

832
01:10:00,322 --> 01:10:02,199
...I didn't seek you
out for your advice.

833
01:10:02,366 --> 01:10:04,493
I sought you out to
purchase a fighting nigger

834
01:10:04,660 --> 01:10:07,204
at above top-dollar market price.

835
01:10:07,371 --> 01:10:09,915
Now I was under the impression,
when you granted me an audience,

836
01:10:10,082 --> 01:10:12,459
it would be to discuss business.

837
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:17,631
Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.

838
01:10:17,798 --> 01:10:20,134
We were discussin' my curiosity.

839
01:10:22,428 --> 01:10:23,429
Thank you.

840
01:10:23,596 --> 01:10:26,307
Roscoe, Coco,
go outside and play.

841
01:10:28,309 --> 01:10:31,770
Sheba... you stay right there.

842
01:10:31,937 --> 01:10:33,480
I know you didn't mean me.

843
01:10:35,232 --> 01:10:37,735
- Prost!
- German.

844
01:10:38,652 --> 01:10:42,448
Now, according to Moguy,
if I do business with you,

845
01:10:42,615 --> 01:10:44,658
I'm doing business with both y'all.

846
01:10:44,825 --> 01:10:47,244
He does the eyeballin',
you the billfold? Is that it?

847
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:51,165
Well, you don't make it sound
too flattering, but more or less, yeah.

848
01:10:51,332 --> 01:10:52,499
Hm.

849
01:10:53,792 --> 01:10:54,793
So...

850
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:56,879
...Bright Boy...

851
01:10:57,046 --> 01:10:59,006
...Moguy tells me
you looked over my African flesh

852
01:10:59,173 --> 01:11:01,342
and you was
none too impressed, huh?

853
01:11:01,508 --> 01:11:03,010
Not for top dollar.

854
01:11:05,179 --> 01:11:07,222
Well, then,
we got nothin' more to talk about.

855
01:11:07,389 --> 01:11:09,516
You see, you wanna buy
a beat-ass nigger from me,

856
01:11:09,683 --> 01:11:11,936
those are the beat-ass niggers
I wanna sell so...

857
01:11:12,102 --> 01:11:14,063
He don't wanna buy the niggers
you wanna sell.

858
01:11:15,022 --> 01:11:18,192
He wants the nigger
you don't wanna sell.

859
01:11:18,359 --> 01:11:22,655
Well, I don't sell the niggers
I don't wanna sell.

860
01:11:24,907 --> 01:11:28,577
Well, you won't sell your best.

861
01:11:28,744 --> 01:11:31,163
You won't even sell your second best.

862
01:11:31,330 --> 01:11:35,000
But your third best...?
You don't want to sell him either.

863
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:39,088
But if I made you an offer so ridiculous
you'd be forced to consider it...

864
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:41,924
...who knows what could happen?

865
01:11:44,259 --> 01:11:46,553
And what do you consider ridiculous?

866
01:11:47,554 --> 01:11:51,642
For a truly talented specimen,
the right nigger?

867
01:11:53,394 --> 01:11:55,437
How much would you say, Django?

868
01:11:58,816 --> 01:12:00,526
Twelve thousand dollars.

869
01:12:05,072 --> 01:12:09,076
Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity,

870
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,161
but now you have my attention.

871
01:12:24,842 --> 01:12:30,514
Willie. Willie.
Hold up! Hold up. Ah!

872
01:12:30,681 --> 01:12:33,100
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good Dr. Schultz.

873
01:12:33,267 --> 01:12:37,187
- Beautiful morning, isn't it?
- You couldn't have picked a better one.

874
01:12:37,354 --> 01:12:40,232
Please, won't you take a ride with us
here in the Victoria.

875
01:12:40,399 --> 01:12:41,942
Oh, thank you very much.

876
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,236
You can tie your horse up back there.

877
01:12:52,453 --> 01:12:53,746
Django.

878
01:12:58,542 --> 01:13:02,171
Where I part company from many
of my phrenologist colleagues

879
01:13:02,337 --> 01:13:07,509
is I believe there is a level
above bright, above talented,

880
01:13:07,676 --> 01:13:11,805
above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.

881
01:13:11,972 --> 01:13:16,643
Say, one nigger that
just pops up in 10,000.

882
01:13:16,810 --> 01:13:18,312
The exceptional nigger.

883
01:13:19,313 --> 01:13:21,356
Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?

884
01:13:22,483 --> 01:13:23,650
Sun is up.

885
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,695
Shining on all of us.

886
01:13:31,450 --> 01:13:34,369
- Have a seat, doc.
- Thank you.

887
01:13:34,536 --> 01:13:35,829
Quite an honor.

888
01:13:35,996 --> 01:13:37,706
- The honor is all ours.
- Thank you.

889
01:13:37,873 --> 01:13:41,251
<i>But I do believe that,</i>
<i>given time,</i>

890
01:13:41,418 --> 01:13:44,379
exceptional niggers
like Bright Boy here...

891
01:13:45,339 --> 01:13:47,174
...become if not frequent...

892
01:13:48,425 --> 01:13:50,052
...more frequent.

893
01:13:51,804 --> 01:13:56,391
Bright Boy,
you are that one in 10,000.

894
01:13:56,558 --> 01:13:59,436
The name of the game is keep up,
not catch up, nigger.

895
01:14:12,324 --> 01:14:13,700
Whoa!

896
01:14:15,202 --> 01:14:18,622
- Touch your guns, you die.
- Everybody, calm down!

897
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,707
Now I saw the whole thing.
No harm done.

898
01:14:20,874 --> 01:14:21,917
Are you kidding me?

899
01:14:22,084 --> 01:14:24,086
- This nigger just...
- I said no harm done!

900
01:14:24,253 --> 01:14:26,797
Now take your hand off your pistol!

901
01:14:27,881 --> 01:14:30,676
Butch, that means you too.

902
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:34,888
Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.

903
01:14:36,390 --> 01:14:38,600
Hoot! Get back up on your horse.

904
01:14:39,351 --> 01:14:40,894
He broke my collarbone!

905
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:45,357
For God's sake, somebody please help
Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.

906
01:14:45,524 --> 01:14:48,569
- Yessir, boss.
- Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.

907
01:14:49,945 --> 01:14:51,321
You better listen to your boss,
white boy.

908
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:53,949
Oh, I'm gonna go
walking in the moonlight with you.

909
01:14:54,116 --> 01:14:55,909
You wanna hold my hand?

910
01:15:02,499 --> 01:15:05,169
Willie, take us home.

911
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:09,423
Start moving!

912
01:15:15,804 --> 01:15:17,055
Head 'em out!

913
01:16:02,684 --> 01:16:04,228
You got a problem
with your eyeball, boy?

914
01:16:04,394 --> 01:16:05,646
No, sir.

915
01:16:05,812 --> 01:16:07,314
You want a boot heel in it?

916
01:16:08,523 --> 01:16:09,483
No, sir.

917
01:16:09,650 --> 01:16:12,694
Then you keep your
goddamn eyeballs off me.

918
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:15,989
You flash that bad look at me again,
I'll give you a reason not to like me.

919
01:16:16,156 --> 01:16:17,699
Now move, nigger!

920
01:16:19,826 --> 01:16:21,954
You niggers are gonna
understand something about me.

921
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:23,997
I'm worse than any of these
white men here.

922
01:16:24,164 --> 01:16:27,751
You get the molasses out your ass,
you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.

923
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:30,963
He is a rambunctious sort,
ain't he?

924
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,464
Indeed.

925
01:16:34,967 --> 01:16:38,345
May we stop for a moment
so I may put a word in my man's ear?

926
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:42,224
You know, I'm expecting to fall in love
once I see the specimens at Candyland,

927
01:16:42,391 --> 01:16:45,477
so before that moment,
it would be good if I could have

928
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:50,023
a confidential strategy meeting
with my confidant.

929
01:16:52,985 --> 01:16:54,820
You mind telling me
what the hell you doing?

930
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:57,030
I confirmed that Broomhilda's
at Candyland.

931
01:17:01,076 --> 01:17:03,662
- You're sure it's her?
- He didn't call her by name,

932
01:17:03,829 --> 01:17:07,207
but she's a young lady, whip marks
on her back and speaks German.

933
01:17:07,374 --> 01:17:09,251
Now, while it's not wise to assume,

934
01:17:09,418 --> 01:17:11,878
in this instance,
I think it's pretty safe.

935
01:17:12,045 --> 01:17:16,675
Point being, don't get so
carried away with your retribution.

936
01:17:16,842 --> 01:17:18,802
You lose sight of why we're here.

937
01:17:18,969 --> 01:17:20,762
- You think I lost sight of that?
- Yes, I do.

938
01:17:20,929 --> 01:17:23,432
Stop antagonizing Candie.

939
01:17:23,598 --> 01:17:28,562
You're going to blow this whole charade,
or more than likely get us both killed.

940
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:33,400
And I, for one, don't intend to die
in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.

941
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:36,570
I'm not antagonizing him.
I'm intriguing him.

942
01:17:36,737 --> 01:17:39,281
You're yelling abuse
at these poor slaves.

943
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:45,704
I recall the man who had me
kill another man in front of his son

944
01:17:45,871 --> 01:17:47,664
and he didn't bat a eye.

945
01:17:49,082 --> 01:17:50,208
You remember that?

946
01:17:52,461 --> 01:17:53,795
Yeah, of course I remember.

947
01:17:53,962 --> 01:17:57,424
What you said was that
this is my world...

948
01:17:58,383 --> 01:18:00,385
...and in my world you gotta get dirty.

949
01:18:01,386 --> 01:18:04,264
So that's what I'm doing.
I'm gettin' dirty.

950
01:18:07,934 --> 01:18:11,104
Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but...

951
01:18:12,564 --> 01:18:14,649
...that was the general gist.

952
01:18:18,403 --> 01:18:19,905
See you at Candyland.

953
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:30,207
All right, niggers, back at it.

954
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,543
That means you too, Moonlight.

955
01:19:20,924 --> 01:19:23,802
I'll be. D'Artagnan!

956
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:27,222
Now, boy, why do a
fool thing like run off?

957
01:19:27,389 --> 01:19:29,474
I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.

958
01:19:29,641 --> 01:19:30,934
Yes, you can.

959
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:34,646
You might not be able to win,
but your ass can fight.

960
01:19:34,813 --> 01:19:37,232
Mr. Stonesipher, would you please
shut these goddamn dogs up?

961
01:19:37,399 --> 01:19:40,026
- I cannot hear myself think!
- Quiet down, Marsha!

962
01:19:40,193 --> 01:19:42,237
Marsha, hush up! Marsha!

963
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,947
Hush up! Hey!

964
01:19:44,114 --> 01:19:46,741
Get these goddamn dogs
away from this nigger!

965
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:59,713
Come on now, boy...
get on out that tree.

966
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:01,548
Yessir.

967
01:20:24,112 --> 01:20:26,239
How long was he loose?

968
01:20:26,406 --> 01:20:29,659
A night. Day.

969
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:31,453
Half the other night.

970
01:20:32,579 --> 01:20:34,122
How far he get off the property?

971
01:20:34,289 --> 01:20:35,999
'Bout 20 miles off the prop.

972
01:20:36,166 --> 01:20:38,293
Pretty far considering
that limp he got.

973
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:39,836
Hm.

974
01:20:41,087 --> 01:20:44,424
Mr. Moguy, who was D'Artagnan
supposed to fight on Friday?

975
01:20:44,591 --> 01:20:46,218
One-a this new lot.

976
01:20:47,385 --> 01:20:50,096
Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian
wouldn't bet a bead on him.

977
01:20:50,263 --> 01:20:52,766
Please, Monsieur
Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.

978
01:20:52,933 --> 01:20:54,434
- Now, now, now, now, now.
- I can't...

979
01:20:54,601 --> 01:20:57,020
Now, no beggin'.

980
01:20:57,187 --> 01:20:59,648
No playin' on my soft heart.

981
01:21:03,109 --> 01:21:05,654
- You in trouble now, son.
- Yessir.

982
01:21:08,573 --> 01:21:12,118
I done paid $500 for you.

983
01:21:12,285 --> 01:21:17,165
When I pay $500, then I expect
to get five fights out of a nigger

984
01:21:17,332 --> 01:21:19,709
- 'fore he roll over and play dead.
- Sir.

985
01:21:19,876 --> 01:21:23,755
You got to understand
that I'm runnin' a business here.

986
01:21:23,922 --> 01:21:26,633
- You fought three fights.
- But I won every one.

987
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,301
Yes, you did. Yes, you did.

988
01:21:28,468 --> 01:21:31,471
But that last one, you muddled the line
between winnin' and losin'.

989
01:21:31,638 --> 01:21:32,681
Yessir.

990
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:37,394
Still, the fact remains:

991
01:21:37,561 --> 01:21:41,189
I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!

992
01:21:41,356 --> 01:21:43,900
So what about my $500, huh?

993
01:21:45,777 --> 01:21:47,696
What about my $500?

994
01:21:49,239 --> 01:21:50,782
You gonna reimburse me?

995
01:21:56,788 --> 01:21:59,165
You even know what "reimburse" means?

996
01:21:59,332 --> 01:22:01,376
Huh?

997
01:22:07,674 --> 01:22:09,384
I'll reimburse you!

998
01:22:13,138 --> 01:22:14,347
You Will?

999
01:22:15,557 --> 01:22:17,100
Yep.

1000
01:22:19,853 --> 01:22:22,564
You'll pay $500

1001
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:26,192
for practically a one-eyed old Joe
ain't fit to push a broom?

1002
01:22:26,359 --> 01:22:27,485
No, he won't.

1003
01:22:29,738 --> 01:22:31,823
He just tired of you
toyin' with him is all.

1004
01:22:32,741 --> 01:22:34,701
Matter of fact, so am I.

1005
01:22:34,868 --> 01:22:37,329
But we ain't payin' a penny
for that pickaninny.

1006
01:22:37,495 --> 01:22:39,289
Ain't got no use for him.
Ain't that right, doc?

1007
01:22:41,041 --> 01:22:42,250
You heard him.

1008
01:22:51,426 --> 01:22:55,180
You're gonna have to excuse
Mr. Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.

1009
01:22:55,347 --> 01:22:59,017
He ain't never seen a
nigger like you ever in his life.

1010
01:22:59,809 --> 01:23:01,770
Ain't that right, Mr. Stonesipher?

1011
01:23:04,022 --> 01:23:05,482
That right.

1012
01:23:06,483 --> 01:23:07,817
For that matter...

1013
01:23:09,110 --> 01:23:10,695
...nor have I.

1014
01:23:16,785 --> 01:23:17,952
Now...

1015
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:22,248
...seein' as you won't pay a penny
for this pickaninny here...

1016
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:28,088
...you won't mind me handlin'
this nigger any way I see fit?

1017
01:23:29,214 --> 01:23:30,757
He's your nigger.

1018
01:23:34,511 --> 01:23:36,596
Mr. Stonesipher?

1019
01:23:37,389 --> 01:23:41,351
Let Marsha and her bitches
send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.

1020
01:23:41,518 --> 01:23:46,314
Marsha! Marsha, hey, get him!

1021
01:23:47,774 --> 01:23:49,984
Get 'im, get 'im!

1022
01:23:51,027 --> 01:23:53,530
- Yeah!
- Whoo!

1023
01:23:53,697 --> 01:23:55,115
Whoo-ee!

1024
01:24:23,476 --> 01:24:25,520
Your boss looks a little
green around the gills

1025
01:24:25,687 --> 01:24:27,856
for a blood sport like nigger fighting.

1026
01:24:28,022 --> 01:24:32,652
Nah, he just ain't used to seein'
a man ripped apart by dogs is all.

1027
01:24:33,236 --> 01:24:34,529
Hm.

1028
01:24:35,613 --> 01:24:36,990
You are used to it?

1029
01:24:37,157 --> 01:24:40,118
I'm just a little more
used to Americans than he is.

1030
01:24:40,285 --> 01:24:44,998
- Hm.
- Now, Monsieur Candie...

1031
01:24:45,165 --> 01:24:46,791
...whenever you're ready.

1032
01:24:46,958 --> 01:24:50,336
We rode five hours
so you could show off your stock.

1033
01:24:50,503 --> 01:24:52,130
Let's get to it.

1034
01:24:53,339 --> 01:24:57,719
'Cause as of now,
if he's an example, I ain't impressed.

1035
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:01,347
Follow me.

1036
01:26:58,631 --> 01:27:01,342
Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.

1037
01:27:02,969 --> 01:27:04,345
Stand up straight, now!

1038
01:27:05,513 --> 01:27:06,806
Get up there.

1039
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,559
Get up there, boy. Come on.

1040
01:27:09,726 --> 01:27:11,352
Give me a line! Give me a line!

1041
01:27:11,519 --> 01:27:13,605
Get in line there! Straighten up!

1042
01:28:13,247 --> 01:28:14,874
Hello! Stephen, my boy!

1043
01:28:15,041 --> 01:28:17,710
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hello, my ass.

1044
01:28:17,877 --> 01:28:20,838
Who this nigger up on that nag?

1045
01:28:21,005 --> 01:28:24,342
Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
What's-a matter? Why you so ornery?

1046
01:28:24,509 --> 01:28:26,886
- You miss me, huh?
- Oh, yessir.

1047
01:28:27,053 --> 01:28:30,598
I miss you like a hog miss slop!

1048
01:28:30,765 --> 01:28:34,686
Like a baby miss mammy's titty.

1049
01:28:34,852 --> 01:28:38,690
I miss you like I misses
a rock in my shoe.

1050
01:28:41,109 --> 01:28:45,571
Now, I axed you:
Who this nigger on that nag?

1051
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:47,407
Hey, Snowball?

1052
01:28:48,616 --> 01:28:52,203
Wanna know my name or
the name of my horse, you ask me.

1053
01:28:52,370 --> 01:28:55,206
Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball," horse boy?

1054
01:28:55,373 --> 01:28:57,041
I'll snatch your
black ass off that nag there

1055
01:28:57,208 --> 01:28:58,584
- and in the mud so fast...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1056
01:28:58,751 --> 01:29:00,837
- ...make your head spin.
- Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.

1057
01:29:01,004 --> 01:29:05,299
Let's keep it funny.
Django here's a free man.

1058
01:29:05,466 --> 01:29:07,844
- This nigger here?
- That nigger there.

1059
01:29:08,011 --> 01:29:10,263
Let me at least
introduce the two of you.

1060
01:29:10,430 --> 01:29:14,225
Django, this is another cheeky
black bugger like yourself, Stephen.

1061
01:29:14,392 --> 01:29:17,645
Stephen, this here's Django.
You two oughta hate each other.

1062
01:29:17,812 --> 01:29:21,816
Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger
you feels the need to entertain?

1063
01:29:21,983 --> 01:29:25,903
Django and his friend in gray here,
Dr. Schultz, are customers.

1064
01:29:26,070 --> 01:29:27,447
And they are our guests, Stephen.

1065
01:29:27,613 --> 01:29:31,117
And you, you old decrepit bastard,
oughta show them every hospitality.

1066
01:29:31,284 --> 01:29:33,661
- You understand that?
- Yessir. Him I understand.

1067
01:29:33,828 --> 01:29:35,496
But I don't know why
I got to take lip off this nigger.

1068
01:29:35,663 --> 01:29:38,291
You don't have to know why.
Do you understand?

1069
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:40,793
Yessir. I understand.

1070
01:29:40,960 --> 01:29:43,421
Well, good.
They're spendin' the night.

1071
01:29:43,588 --> 01:29:45,715
Go up in the guest bedrooms
and get two ready.

1072
01:29:46,883 --> 01:29:48,551
He gonna stay in The Big House?

1073
01:29:48,718 --> 01:29:50,928
Stephen, he's a slaver.
It's different.

1074
01:29:51,095 --> 01:29:53,681
- In The Big House?
- Well, you got a problem with that?

1075
01:29:53,848 --> 01:29:56,142
Oh, no.
I ain't got no problem with it,

1076
01:29:56,309 --> 01:29:58,352
if you ain't got no problem
with burnin' the bed, the sheets,

1077
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:00,855
the pillowcases, everything else when
this black-ass motherfucker's gone!

1078
01:30:01,022 --> 01:30:03,274
That is my problem!
They are mine to burn!

1079
01:30:03,441 --> 01:30:05,651
Now your problem right now
is makin' a good impression!

1080
01:30:05,818 --> 01:30:07,737
And I want you to start solvin'
that problem right now

1081
01:30:07,904 --> 01:30:09,530
and get them goddamn rooms ready!

1082
01:30:11,657 --> 01:30:13,576
Yessir, Monsieur Candie.

1083
01:30:15,036 --> 01:30:16,204
Go on, now.

1084
01:30:17,121 --> 01:30:19,540
Can't believe you brought
a nigger to stay in The Big House.

1085
01:30:19,707 --> 01:30:21,042
Your daddy rollin' over
in his goddamned grave.

1086
01:30:21,209 --> 01:30:24,754
Man, the lip on him. Whoo!
He's gettin' worse and worse.

1087
01:30:24,921 --> 01:30:26,089
Now...

1088
01:30:26,255 --> 01:30:30,927
Where is my beautiful sister?!

1089
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:34,180
There she is!
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

1090
01:30:34,347 --> 01:30:39,393
Dr. Schultz, this attractive
Southern belle is my widowed sister.

1091
01:30:39,560 --> 01:30:43,564
Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.

1092
01:30:44,816 --> 01:30:48,194
May I present to you
Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.

1093
01:30:48,361 --> 01:30:51,739
Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
Y'all get your ass over by that pen.

1094
01:30:51,906 --> 01:30:54,033
- Come on, Charly. Come on, now!
- Let's go.

1095
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:55,243
You know where it is.

1096
01:30:55,409 --> 01:30:57,161
Like you on a rope!

1097
01:30:58,371 --> 01:31:01,124
Niggers don't walk around here,
niggers run!

1098
01:31:01,833 --> 01:31:04,836
- Monsieur Candie?
- Hm?

1099
01:31:05,002 --> 01:31:08,798
Yeah. About that matter about the
nigger girl you were talking about?

1100
01:31:08,965 --> 01:31:09,924
Nigger gal?

1101
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:13,094
Yeah, I believe you mentioned
she spoke German.

1102
01:31:13,261 --> 01:31:15,847
Ah, yes! Hildi, what about her?

1103
01:31:16,013 --> 01:31:20,184
Do you think before the demonstration,
you could send her around to my room?

1104
01:31:20,351 --> 01:31:24,522
You little dickens, you.
I don't see why not.

1105
01:31:24,689 --> 01:31:28,067
Stephen, when you get through showin'
them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi,

1106
01:31:28,234 --> 01:31:30,069
get her cleaned up
and smellin' real nice,

1107
01:31:30,236 --> 01:31:31,654
and sent over to
Dr. Schultz's room here.

1108
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:33,489
Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir,

1109
01:31:33,656 --> 01:31:36,325
there's-a somethin'
I ain't told you 'bout yet.

1110
01:31:36,534 --> 01:31:40,204
- What?
- Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.

1111
01:31:41,706 --> 01:31:42,874
What's she doin' there?

1112
01:31:43,040 --> 01:31:45,793
What you think she
doin' there in the Hot Box?

1113
01:31:45,960 --> 01:31:47,420
She bein' punished.

1114
01:31:47,587 --> 01:31:49,922
- What she do?
- She run off again.

1115
01:31:50,089 --> 01:31:52,758
Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people
ran away while I was gone?

1116
01:31:52,925 --> 01:31:55,428
- Two.
- When did she go?

1117
01:31:55,595 --> 01:31:58,097
Last night.
They brung her back this morning.

1118
01:31:58,264 --> 01:32:00,933
How bad did Stonesipher's dogs
tear her up?

1119
01:32:01,851 --> 01:32:05,354
Lucky for her,
they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.

1120
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:09,817
Bill and Cody went lookin' for her,
found her, brung her back.

1121
01:32:09,984 --> 01:32:12,904
Now, she a little beat-up.
But she done that to her own damn self

1122
01:32:13,070 --> 01:32:14,280
runnin' through them
damn bushes and shit.

1123
01:32:14,447 --> 01:32:16,115
How long she been in the box?

1124
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:19,076
How long you think
she been in there? All damn day.

1125
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,913
And the little bitch
got ten more days to be in there.

1126
01:32:22,079 --> 01:32:25,124
- Still, take her out.
- Take her out? Why?

1127
01:32:25,291 --> 01:32:29,212
Because I said so, that's why.
Dr. Schultz is my guest.

1128
01:32:29,378 --> 01:32:30,338
Hildi is my nigger.

1129
01:32:30,504 --> 01:32:33,674
Southern hospitality dictates
I make her available to him.

1130
01:32:33,841 --> 01:32:37,053
- But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
- Jesus Christ, Stephen.

1131
01:32:37,220 --> 01:32:39,639
What is the point of havin'
a nigger that speaks German

1132
01:32:39,805 --> 01:32:42,266
if you can't wheel 'em out
when you have a German guest?

1133
01:32:42,433 --> 01:32:46,604
Now, I realize it is inconvenient,
but still, you take her ass out.

1134
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:47,939
Yessir.

1135
01:32:49,232 --> 01:32:51,817
Lara Lee!
Will you and Cora be responsible

1136
01:32:51,984 --> 01:32:55,363
for gettin' Hildi cleaned up
and presentable for Dr. Schultz here.

1137
01:32:55,529 --> 01:32:56,906
Of course, darlin'.

1138
01:32:57,073 --> 01:33:01,953
Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am
weary from our travels beyond words.

1139
01:33:02,119 --> 01:33:04,997
It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.

1140
01:33:09,835 --> 01:33:12,588
Y'all done heard the man!
Get her ass up outta there!

1141
01:33:12,755 --> 01:33:15,299
Cora! Come here!

1142
01:33:15,466 --> 01:33:18,511
Get over there and get her cleaned up,
bring her back over here to Dr...

1143
01:33:18,678 --> 01:33:21,055
- What he say your name is? Shoots?
- Schultz.

1144
01:33:21,222 --> 01:33:23,683
Schultz. Get her back over here.
Hurry up, girl.

1145
01:33:23,849 --> 01:33:27,228
Yessir.

1146
01:34:10,813 --> 01:34:13,524
Come on, girl. Stand up.

1147
01:34:43,554 --> 01:34:47,099
Is you comin' with me or is you gonna
sleep in that little box over yonder?

1148
01:36:22,278 --> 01:36:23,737
Hello, ladies.

1149
01:36:23,904 --> 01:36:27,283
Dr. Schultz.
May I introduce to you Broomhilda?

1150
01:36:31,454 --> 01:36:33,914
Hildi, this is Dr. Schultz.

1151
01:36:35,374 --> 01:36:37,501
It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.

1152
01:36:38,544 --> 01:36:40,880
I've heard a lot of
good things about you.

1153
01:36:41,046 --> 01:36:43,841
Well, it's not every nigger
speaks German, don't ya know.

1154
01:36:47,094 --> 01:36:49,096
As I look at you now, Broomhilda,

1155
01:36:49,263 --> 01:36:54,226
I can see all the passions you inspire
are completely justified.

1156
01:36:57,563 --> 01:36:59,899
The doctor here speaks German.

1157
01:37:01,901 --> 01:37:03,861
And I've been informed you do as well?

1158
01:37:05,404 --> 01:37:07,573
Go ahead, girl.
Speak a little German.

1159
01:37:14,121 --> 01:37:15,748
Ha!

1160
01:37:15,915 --> 01:37:17,917
Astonishing.

1161
01:37:24,882 --> 01:37:27,092
- And I shall bring you...
- Much obliged.

1162
01:37:36,602 --> 01:37:37,728
<i>Ja.</i>

1163
01:38:01,126 --> 01:38:02,586
Don't be afraid.

1164
01:38:40,666 --> 01:38:43,168
Hm. Pardon.

1165
01:38:50,759 --> 01:38:52,052
<i>Danke.</i>

1166
01:40:37,491 --> 01:40:39,076
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1167
01:40:47,668 --> 01:40:50,963
You silver-tongued devil, you.

1168
01:40:52,548 --> 01:40:53,882
- Hurry up, girl.
- These ready, Miss Cora.

1169
01:40:54,049 --> 01:40:55,300
No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.

1170
01:40:55,467 --> 01:40:58,429
Go downstairs, get the big jug with the
red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?

1171
01:40:58,595 --> 01:41:01,348
- Get your big pretty ass out the way.
- You know you like it.

1172
01:41:01,515 --> 01:41:03,726
That's 'cause
you knows what I like.

1173
01:41:03,892 --> 01:41:06,478
Ooh!
Come on with these biscuits, girl.

1174
01:41:06,645 --> 01:41:12,443
Look, Monsieur Candie, they were
all fine specimens, no doubt about it.

1175
01:41:12,609 --> 01:41:16,989
But the best three by far were Samson...

1176
01:41:18,365 --> 01:41:19,950
- What's that other one's name?
- Goldie.

1177
01:41:20,117 --> 01:41:23,454
Goldie. And Eskimo Joe.

1178
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:26,206
By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?

1179
01:41:26,373 --> 01:41:29,460
You never know how
these nigger nicknames get started.

1180
01:41:29,626 --> 01:41:32,212
His name was Joe, maybe one day
he said he was cold. Who knows?

1181
01:41:35,883 --> 01:41:41,221
Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
We all know that.

1182
01:41:41,388 --> 01:41:45,100
You will never sell him,
and I can see why. He's a champion.

1183
01:41:45,267 --> 01:41:49,021
Hm-hm.
All three are champions.

1184
01:41:49,688 --> 01:41:51,774
Samson's the champion.

1185
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:53,734
Them other two pretty good.

1186
01:41:55,027 --> 01:41:56,528
Calvin, now what's
this nigger you let...

1187
01:41:56,695 --> 01:41:57,821
It's all right.

1188
01:41:57,988 --> 01:42:00,073
You have to understand,
Monsieur Candie,

1189
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:03,619
while admittedly a neophyte
in the nigger fight game,

1190
01:42:03,786 --> 01:42:08,081
I do have a little bit of a background
in the European traveling circus.

1191
01:42:08,248 --> 01:42:09,333
Is that right?

1192
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:13,587
Hence, I have big ideas
when it comes to presentation.

1193
01:42:13,754 --> 01:42:14,713
Hm.

1194
01:42:14,880 --> 01:42:17,341
I need something more
than just a big nigger.

1195
01:42:19,092 --> 01:42:21,303
Yeah, he needs to have panache.

1196
01:42:21,470 --> 01:42:24,556
- Need to have what? What?
- Panache. Uh...

1197
01:42:24,723 --> 01:42:27,476
- A sense of Showmanship.
- Showmanship, yes.

1198
01:42:27,643 --> 01:42:30,854
I want to be able to bill him
as The Black Hercules.

1199
01:42:32,815 --> 01:42:34,191
The Black Hercules,
isn't that clever?

1200
01:42:34,358 --> 01:42:35,359
More like Nigger-les.

1201
01:42:37,820 --> 01:42:43,200
I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for...

1202
01:42:43,700 --> 01:42:46,495
...'the right nigger."'

1203
01:42:46,662 --> 01:42:50,958
Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe
is the wrong nigger, per se.

1204
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:53,836
But is he right as rain?

1205
01:42:55,087 --> 01:42:56,505
Oh, Dr. Schultz,

1206
01:42:56,672 --> 01:43:00,467
I will have you know there
is no one in the nigger fight game

1207
01:43:00,634 --> 01:43:02,553
that appreciates
the value of showmanship

1208
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:04,471
more than Monsieur
Calvin J. Candie here.

1209
01:43:04,638 --> 01:43:05,639
Nobody.

1210
01:43:05,806 --> 01:43:07,641
But one must not forget
the most important thing

1211
01:43:07,808 --> 01:43:09,184
- in the nigger fight game.
- Hm-mm.

1212
01:43:09,351 --> 01:43:11,353
And that is a nigger
that can win fights.

1213
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:12,729
Hm-mm.

1214
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:17,109
Now that should be your first, second,
third, fourth, and fifth concern.

1215
01:43:17,276 --> 01:43:19,319
Now, after you have that,
and you know you have that,

1216
01:43:19,486 --> 01:43:23,448
then you can start
to implement a grand design.

1217
01:43:23,615 --> 01:43:26,159
In other words, first thing is first.

1218
01:43:26,326 --> 01:43:27,786
First thing's first.

1219
01:43:35,460 --> 01:43:38,839
Ooh! I see you two gettin' on.

1220
01:43:39,006 --> 01:43:40,883
Famously.

1221
01:43:41,633 --> 01:43:44,303
Oh, Monsieur Candie,
you can't imagine what it's like

1222
01:43:44,469 --> 01:43:47,806
not to hear your
native tongue in four years.

1223
01:43:47,973 --> 01:43:49,808
Well, hell,
I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.

1224
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:54,271
Two weeks in Boston!

1225
01:43:54,438 --> 01:43:57,232
Monsieur Candie, you a mess!

1226
01:43:57,399 --> 01:43:59,109
Two weeks in Boston!

1227
01:43:59,276 --> 01:44:04,489
I can't express the joy I felt
conversing in my mother tongue.

1228
01:44:04,656 --> 01:44:08,744
And Hildi is a charming
conversation companion.

1229
01:44:08,911 --> 01:44:10,787
Well, be careful now,
Dr. Schultz.

1230
01:44:10,954 --> 01:44:12,289
You might-a caught yourself

1231
01:44:12,456 --> 01:44:13,707
- a little dose of nigger love.
- Hm!

1232
01:44:13,874 --> 01:44:15,959
Nigger love's
a powerful emotion, boy.

1233
01:44:16,126 --> 01:44:18,128
- Hm!
- It's like a pool of black tar.

1234
01:44:18,295 --> 01:44:19,922
Once it catches your ass, you're caught.

1235
01:44:20,088 --> 01:44:23,050
Yessir, you stuck.

1236
01:44:23,216 --> 01:44:24,760
I don't know, doctor.

1237
01:44:24,927 --> 01:44:27,179
You can lay on all the
German sweet talk you want,

1238
01:44:27,346 --> 01:44:31,850
but it looks like this pony's
got big eyes for Django.

1239
01:44:34,269 --> 01:44:36,730
Well, naturally.

1240
01:44:36,897 --> 01:44:40,525
It is the soaring eagle
that attracts her attention,

1241
01:44:40,692 --> 01:44:43,487
not the plucked chicken.

1242
01:44:43,654 --> 01:44:46,156
Dr. Schultz, don't be
so down on yourself.

1243
01:44:46,323 --> 01:44:48,241
You are quite the dapper
European gentleman.

1244
01:44:48,408 --> 01:44:49,451
You got to clean these dishes,

1245
01:44:49,618 --> 01:44:51,620
you got to put your elbow
in these dishes, you hear me?

1246
01:44:51,787 --> 01:44:53,997
You know that nigger, don't you?

1247
01:44:54,915 --> 01:44:56,208
- Who?
- "Who?"

1248
01:44:56,375 --> 01:44:59,461
Don't "who" me, bitch.
You know who I'm talkin' about.

1249
01:45:01,213 --> 01:45:03,215
At the table?

1250
01:45:03,382 --> 01:45:04,633
I don't know him.

1251
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,844
- You don't know him.
- No.

1252
01:45:08,011 --> 01:45:10,847
- "No," what?
- No, sir.

1253
01:45:15,477 --> 01:45:17,938
You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?

1254
01:45:22,150 --> 01:45:23,360
OK.

1255
01:45:24,611 --> 01:45:27,739
Yeah. If you say so.

1256
01:45:34,204 --> 01:45:37,624
Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger,
no doubt about it.

1257
01:45:39,001 --> 01:45:44,172
But if it was my money,
I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.

1258
01:45:44,339 --> 01:45:46,675
What would your price be?

1259
01:45:46,842 --> 01:45:48,802
Well, if I was inclined
to be generous...

1260
01:45:48,969 --> 01:45:52,431
...and I don't know why
I would be inclined to be generous...

1261
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:56,643
...9,000. Maybe.

1262
01:45:57,894 --> 01:46:03,692
Dr. Schultz, let me reclarify how
this whole negotiation came about.

1263
01:46:03,859 --> 01:46:06,028
You see, it wasn't me
who came to you to sell a nigger.

1264
01:46:06,194 --> 01:46:07,154
Sure wasn't.

1265
01:46:07,320 --> 01:46:09,031
It was you who approached me to buy one.

1266
01:46:09,197 --> 01:46:11,366
- Sure was.
- Now, that $9,000 figure

1267
01:46:11,533 --> 01:46:13,952
Bright Boy's been bandyin' about,
that ain't too far off from right.

1268
01:46:14,119 --> 01:46:15,746
And if I wanted to sell
Eskimo Joe for that,

1269
01:46:15,912 --> 01:46:18,874
- I could do so any day of the week.
- Any day.

1270
01:46:19,041 --> 01:46:23,295
But, like you said in Greenville,
doctor... I don't want to sell him.

1271
01:46:23,920 --> 01:46:27,924
It was only your ridiculous
offer of $12,000

1272
01:46:28,091 --> 01:46:30,927
- that made me even consider it.
- Hm-mm.

1273
01:46:39,102 --> 01:46:43,190
You know, Monsieur Candie,
you do possess the power of persuasion.

1274
01:46:47,110 --> 01:46:49,529
Why not?
Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.

1275
01:46:49,696 --> 01:46:53,033
- Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
- Hooray, doctor.

1276
01:46:53,200 --> 01:46:55,327
Hooray.
And a wise decision that is.

1277
01:46:55,494 --> 01:46:59,039
However, that is
a tremendous amount of money.

1278
01:46:59,206 --> 01:47:02,375
And the way you have
your Mr. Moguy, I have a lawyer.

1279
01:47:02,542 --> 01:47:04,336
Persnickety man named Tuttle.

1280
01:47:04,503 --> 01:47:07,589
And I would need my Mr. Tuttle
to draw up a legal contract

1281
01:47:07,756 --> 01:47:10,801
before I'd feel comfortable exchanging
that amount of money for flesh.

1282
01:47:10,967 --> 01:47:11,968
Hm-mm.

1283
01:47:12,135 --> 01:47:13,804
Not to mention having
Eskimo Joe examined

1284
01:47:13,970 --> 01:47:16,598
- by a physician of my choosing.
- Naturally.

1285
01:47:16,765 --> 01:47:21,478
So, say I return in about...

1286
01:47:23,647 --> 01:47:25,941
- ...five days time.
- Five days?

1287
01:47:26,108 --> 01:47:27,359
With my Mr. Tuttle.

1288
01:47:27,526 --> 01:47:29,569
And then my Mr. Tuttle
and your Mr. Moguy

1289
01:47:29,736 --> 01:47:32,697
can hash out the finer
details between themselves.

1290
01:47:33,532 --> 01:47:36,576
I say splendid, doctor. Splendid.

1291
01:47:37,327 --> 01:47:38,495
Gentlemen...

1292
01:47:39,496 --> 01:47:41,498
...may I propose a toast.

1293
01:47:43,875 --> 01:47:48,755
To Eskimo Joe.
Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?

1294
01:47:48,922 --> 01:47:51,591
To The Black Hercules.

1295
01:47:51,758 --> 01:47:53,135
The Black Hercules.

1296
01:47:53,301 --> 01:47:54,719
To The Black Hercules.

1297
01:47:54,886 --> 01:47:58,723
You was right, doctor.
That name do have pan-ass.

1298
01:47:58,890 --> 01:48:00,308
Hm.

1299
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:03,728
Hildi, top my drink off.

1300
01:48:06,815 --> 01:48:11,862
So, Hildi, how you like servin'
at the big table in The Big House, huh?

1301
01:48:12,028 --> 01:48:15,240
When Monsieur Candie talk to you,
you answers.

1302
01:48:15,407 --> 01:48:18,160
- I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
- Hm-mm.

1303
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:21,079
It's a lot better than sizzlin'
in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass

1304
01:48:21,246 --> 01:48:22,581
through a bramble bush.

1305
01:48:22,747 --> 01:48:25,834
But maybe it's not quite as much fun as
gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos,

1306
01:48:26,001 --> 01:48:27,586
- huh, sugar bear?
- Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.

1307
01:48:27,752 --> 01:48:28,920
- Sure do.
- Like Samson? Huh?

1308
01:48:29,087 --> 01:48:30,547
No, sir.

1309
01:48:30,714 --> 01:48:32,048
You know, Monsieur Candie,

1310
01:48:32,215 --> 01:48:35,886
the doctor here might be interested
in seein' Hildi's peeled back,

1311
01:48:36,052 --> 01:48:39,306
seein' as how they don't have
many niggers where he come from.

1312
01:48:39,472 --> 01:48:41,600
Dr. Schultz,
when you was alone with Hildi, here,

1313
01:48:41,766 --> 01:48:44,811
did you just speak German
or did you get to take her clothes off?

1314
01:48:44,978 --> 01:48:46,730
No, we just talked and...

1315
01:48:46,897 --> 01:48:49,274
Oh, so you
haven't seen her back?

1316
01:48:49,441 --> 01:48:51,234
- I haven't...
- No, no, no, no.

1317
01:48:51,401 --> 01:48:53,445
Stephen's right,
you might find this interesting.

1318
01:48:53,612 --> 01:48:56,698
Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
Show Dr. Schultz your back here.

1319
01:48:56,865 --> 01:48:58,825
- Go on.
- Uh, Calvin.

1320
01:48:58,992 --> 01:49:01,369
I just got her all dressed up
and lookin' nice.

1321
01:49:01,536 --> 01:49:04,456
But, Lara Lee,
Dr. Schultz is from Dusseldorf.

1322
01:49:04,623 --> 01:49:07,626
They don't got niggers there.
He is a man of medicine.

1323
01:49:07,792 --> 01:49:10,378
I'm sure it would fascinate him,
the niggers' endurance for pain.

1324
01:49:10,545 --> 01:49:14,132
These niggers are tough,
Dr. Schultz, no doubt about it.

1325
01:49:14,299 --> 01:49:16,468
Hildi's got somethin'
like four lashes on her back.

1326
01:49:16,635 --> 01:49:18,553
Lara Lee just get one,
she'd lose her goddamn mind.

1327
01:49:18,762 --> 01:49:19,846
- Sure would.
- Look at that, doctor.

1328
01:49:20,013 --> 01:49:22,265
- It's like a paintin'. Look at that.
- Calvin!

1329
01:49:23,058 --> 01:49:26,102
We are eating. Ain't no one wanna
look at her whipped up back.

1330
01:49:27,771 --> 01:49:30,190
Fine. Fine, fine, fine, fine.

1331
01:49:30,357 --> 01:49:33,026
After dinner, then, Stephen.
After dinner.

1332
01:49:34,236 --> 01:49:36,029
During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?

1333
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:43,954
Cora, come get this girl!

1334
01:49:47,415 --> 01:49:50,627
- She a mess.
- Yes, ma'am. Oh!

1335
01:49:50,794 --> 01:49:53,255
Why are you all undone?
I just got you done up.

1336
01:49:53,421 --> 01:49:54,756
Come on in here.

1337
01:50:01,263 --> 01:50:05,058
Baby, you on Stephen bad side,
and you need to be on his blind side.

1338
01:50:05,225 --> 01:50:07,185
You say you ain't know him.

1339
01:50:08,311 --> 01:50:09,396
Huh?

1340
01:50:09,562 --> 01:50:15,151
I said, you said you ain't know him.

1341
01:50:16,319 --> 01:50:19,698
- I don't.
- Yes, you do.

1342
01:50:21,866 --> 01:50:23,493
Mr. Stephen...

1343
01:50:24,494 --> 01:50:25,495
...I don't.

1344
01:50:25,662 --> 01:50:28,164
Why is you lying to me?

1345
01:50:30,542 --> 01:50:31,876
I ain't.

1346
01:50:32,043 --> 01:50:34,546
Then why is you crying?

1347
01:50:34,713 --> 01:50:36,881
You scarin' me.

1348
01:50:37,048 --> 01:50:40,969
- Why is I'm scaring you?
- Because you scary.

1349
01:50:42,637 --> 01:50:45,724
To speak German
this afternoon with Hildi

1350
01:50:45,890 --> 01:50:49,019
was positively soul-enriching.

1351
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:52,063
Doctor,
that warms my heart to hear that.

1352
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:55,066
You stay right here.

1353
01:51:00,405 --> 01:51:04,909
You indicated earlier
you'd be willing to part with Hildi.

1354
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:07,912
Why, yes.
Yessiree bob, I did.

1355
01:51:09,914 --> 01:51:15,879
In that case, allow me
to propose another proposition.

1356
01:51:16,046 --> 01:51:17,422
I'm all ears.

1357
01:51:17,589 --> 01:51:19,299
Hurry up, goddamn it!

1358
01:51:19,924 --> 01:51:21,509
- Monsieur Candie...
- Stephen!

1359
01:51:22,552 --> 01:51:25,013
You just interrupted Dr. Schultz here.

1360
01:51:26,139 --> 01:51:28,266
I'm sorry, Dr. Schultz.

1361
01:51:28,433 --> 01:51:31,144
My ears ain't worth a damn these days.

1362
01:51:31,311 --> 01:51:32,437
Excuse him.

1363
01:51:32,604 --> 01:51:36,358
Monsieur Candie, could I get
a word with you in the kitchen?

1364
01:51:36,524 --> 01:51:38,443
You mean get up out of my chair?

1365
01:51:38,610 --> 01:51:41,946
- If'n you could manage it.
- Why?

1366
01:51:42,113 --> 01:51:45,950
- It's about dessert.
- What about dessert?

1367
01:51:46,117 --> 01:51:48,745
I'd rather discuss that in private.

1368
01:51:48,912 --> 01:51:50,789
We're having white cake!

1369
01:51:50,955 --> 01:51:53,291
What sort of melodrama
could be brewing back there?

1370
01:51:53,458 --> 01:51:57,796
You right, Monsieur Candie.
You right. I'll handle it myself.

1371
01:51:57,962 --> 01:51:59,756
Meet me in the library.

1372
01:51:59,923 --> 01:52:03,009
I just can't understand why you
won't come talk to these niggers.

1373
01:52:03,176 --> 01:52:05,053
Shit get fucked up around here,
you blame me.

1374
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:10,225
Fine! Fine. Friend Stephen,
I will be along momentarily.

1375
01:52:10,392 --> 01:52:11,559
Yessir.

1376
01:52:12,477 --> 01:52:16,147
Well, gentlemen, as you can see,

1377
01:52:16,314 --> 01:52:18,066
talented as they are,
no doubt, in the kitchen,

1378
01:52:18,233 --> 01:52:21,861
from time to time,
adult supervision is required.

1379
01:52:24,864 --> 01:52:26,658
If you'll excuse me a moment.

1380
01:52:32,831 --> 01:52:34,624
You may clear
the dinner service.

1381
01:52:36,084 --> 01:52:39,462
You heard him. Go on!
Get! Hurry up, girl.

1382
01:52:39,629 --> 01:52:45,051
So, Dr. Schultz, why don't you
regale us with a tale of the circus.

1383
01:52:45,218 --> 01:52:47,887
The circus?

1384
01:52:54,352 --> 01:52:56,146
What is the matter?

1385
01:53:01,401 --> 01:53:06,489
Them motherfuckers
ain't here to buy no Mandingos.

1386
01:53:06,656 --> 01:53:10,201
They wants that girl.

1387
01:53:10,368 --> 01:53:13,121
Stephen, what the hell
are you talking about? Hm?

1388
01:53:13,288 --> 01:53:16,458
They playing your ass for a fool
is what I'm talking about.

1389
01:53:16,624 --> 01:53:20,295
They ain't here for
no musclebound Jimmie.

1390
01:53:20,462 --> 01:53:22,630
They here for that girl.

1391
01:53:22,797 --> 01:53:25,425
Wh... What girl? Hildi?

1392
01:53:25,592 --> 01:53:29,220
Yeah, Hildi. Her and Django,
them niggers know each other.

1393
01:53:30,930 --> 01:53:32,515
He just bought Eskimo Joe.

1394
01:53:32,682 --> 01:53:35,059
- Did he give you any money?
- No! Not yet. But...

1395
01:53:35,226 --> 01:53:37,687
Then he ain't bought diddly.
Not yet, nohow.

1396
01:53:37,854 --> 01:53:40,106
But he's just about to buy

1397
01:53:40,273 --> 01:53:43,485
who he come here to buy
when I interrupted him.

1398
01:53:43,651 --> 01:53:46,654
"Thank you, Stephen."
You're welcome, Calvin.

1399
01:53:52,076 --> 01:53:54,078
Where you gettin' all this?

1400
01:53:55,205 --> 01:53:56,998
Why would they go through
all that trouble for a nigger

1401
01:53:57,165 --> 01:53:59,667
with a chewed up back,
ain't worth $300?

1402
01:53:59,834 --> 01:54:04,130
They doin' it 'cause that nigger
Django's in love with Hildi.

1403
01:54:04,297 --> 01:54:06,132
She probably his wife.

1404
01:54:06,299 --> 01:54:09,093
Now, why that German gives a fuck
who that uppity son of a bitch

1405
01:54:09,260 --> 01:54:12,347
is in love with,
I'm sure I don't know.

1406
01:54:14,933 --> 01:54:16,893
If she's who they want...

1407
01:54:17,477 --> 01:54:21,773
...why this whole snake oil pitch
about Mandingos, then?

1408
01:54:21,940 --> 01:54:25,443
You wouldn't pay no
never mind to no $300.

1409
01:54:25,610 --> 01:54:31,074
But that 12,000? That made you
real friendly, now, didn't it?

1410
01:54:33,785 --> 01:54:35,453
Yes, it did.

1411
01:54:38,790 --> 01:54:40,416
His wife, huh?

1412
01:54:44,295 --> 01:54:48,007
If it had been a snake,
it would have bit me.

1413
01:54:51,302 --> 01:54:53,304
Those lying...

1414
01:54:54,138 --> 01:55:00,144
...goddamn time-wastin'
sons of bitches.

1415
01:55:02,355 --> 01:55:03,523
Sons of bitches!

1416
01:55:04,148 --> 01:55:08,945
...out of New Orleans, so I have quite
a bit of practice with theater types.

1417
01:55:10,196 --> 01:55:11,656
Oh, there you are.

1418
01:55:11,823 --> 01:55:14,617
I was beginning to think that you
and that old crow run off together.

1419
01:55:16,411 --> 01:55:18,580
That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?

1420
01:55:18,746 --> 01:55:21,833
Lara Lee, I was just
looking out the big window.

1421
01:55:22,000 --> 01:55:25,044
Billy Crash is out there
dealing with some shady slaver

1422
01:55:25,211 --> 01:55:26,296
trying to sell a passel of ponies.

1423
01:55:26,462 --> 01:55:30,341
Would you be a dear, go out there
and give them gals an eyeball? Hm?

1424
01:55:30,508 --> 01:55:32,760
- Of course, brother.
- Thank you, darling.

1425
01:55:46,024 --> 01:55:49,736
- Yeah. Business never sleeps.
- Hm-mm.

1426
01:55:51,779 --> 01:55:54,699
Apropos, before your exit,

1427
01:55:54,866 --> 01:55:58,870
we were discussing the possibility
of my purchasing Broomhilda.

1428
01:55:59,037 --> 01:56:01,956
Ah, yes. Yes, we were, doctor.

1429
01:56:02,123 --> 01:56:04,250
And we will again. In a moment.

1430
01:56:20,725 --> 01:56:22,769
Who's your little friend?

1431
01:56:27,732 --> 01:56:29,233
This is Ben.

1432
01:56:30,568 --> 01:56:35,573
He's a old Joe that
lived around here for a long time.

1433
01:56:35,740 --> 01:56:38,159
And I do mean a long damn time.

1434
01:56:39,243 --> 01:56:42,997
Old Ben here took care of my daddy...

1435
01:56:43,873 --> 01:56:45,917
...and my daddy's daddy.

1436
01:56:46,084 --> 01:56:48,670
Till he up and keeled over one day...

1437
01:56:51,506 --> 01:56:53,174
...Old Ben took care of me.

1438
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:59,555
Growing up the son of a huge
plantation owner in Mississippi

1439
01:56:59,722 --> 01:57:05,603
puts a white man in contact
with a whole lotta black faces.

1440
01:57:07,230 --> 01:57:12,527
I spent my whole life here,
right here in Candyland...

1441
01:57:13,778 --> 01:57:17,573
...surrounded by black faces.

1442
01:57:19,617 --> 01:57:21,953
Now, seeing them every day,
day in, day out,

1443
01:57:22,120 --> 01:57:25,289
I only had one question:

1444
01:57:29,001 --> 01:57:31,462
Why don't they kill us?

1445
01:57:34,465 --> 01:57:39,637
Now, right out there on that porch,
three times a week for 50 years,

1446
01:57:39,804 --> 01:57:44,726
Old Ben here would
shave my daddy with a straight razor.

1447
01:57:44,892 --> 01:57:50,022
Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda
cut my daddy's goddamn throat

1448
01:57:50,189 --> 01:57:53,609
and it wouldn't have taken me
no 50 years to do it, neither.

1449
01:57:56,154 --> 01:57:57,655
But he never did.

1450
01:57:59,532 --> 01:58:00,825
Why not?

1451
01:58:02,201 --> 01:58:06,998
You see, the science of phrenology

1452
01:58:07,165 --> 01:58:12,253
is crucial to understanding
the separation of our two species.

1453
01:58:14,088 --> 01:58:17,800
In the skull of the African here,

1454
01:58:17,967 --> 01:58:20,094
the area associated
with submissiveness

1455
01:58:20,261 --> 01:58:25,767
is larger than any human or any other
subhuman species on planet Earth.

1456
01:58:41,282 --> 01:58:43,242
If you examine...

1457
01:58:44,619 --> 01:58:46,788
...this piece of skull here...

1458
01:58:53,085 --> 01:58:56,672
...you will notice
three distinct dimples.

1459
01:59:00,259 --> 01:59:03,971
Here, here and here.

1460
01:59:04,138 --> 01:59:05,389
Now...

1461
01:59:05,556 --> 01:59:10,561
...if I was holding the skull
of an Isaac Newton or Galileo,

1462
01:59:10,728 --> 01:59:13,231
these three dimples would be
found in the area of the skull

1463
01:59:13,397 --> 01:59:16,734
most associated with... creativity.

1464
01:59:17,401 --> 01:59:19,237
But this is the skull of Old Ben.

1465
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:21,989
And in the skull of Old Ben,

1466
01:59:22,156 --> 01:59:24,450
unburdened by genius,

1467
01:59:24,617 --> 01:59:28,788
these three dimples exist in the area
of the skull most associated with...

1468
01:59:29,914 --> 01:59:31,249
...servility.

1469
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:34,001
Now, Bright Boy...

1470
01:59:34,919 --> 01:59:37,088
...I will admit you are pretty clever.

1471
01:59:39,549 --> 01:59:41,634
But if I took this hammer here...

1472
01:59:43,761 --> 01:59:46,097
...and I bashed in your skull with it...

1473
01:59:47,098 --> 01:59:52,436
...you would have the same
three dimples in the same place...

1474
01:59:53,688 --> 01:59:55,147
...as Old Ben.

1475
01:59:56,274 --> 01:59:59,861
Hey! Now lay your palms
flat on that tabletop!

1476
02:00:00,027 --> 02:00:02,989
If you lift those palms
off that turtle shell tabletop,

1477
02:00:03,155 --> 02:00:06,409
Mr. Pooch is gonna let loose
with both barrels of that sawed-off.

1478
02:00:07,493 --> 02:00:10,621
There have been a lot of lies said
around this dinner table here tonight,

1479
02:00:10,788 --> 02:00:13,124
but that you can believe!

1480
02:00:13,291 --> 02:00:16,085
Mr. Moguy, would you be
so kind as to collect the pistol

1481
02:00:16,252 --> 02:00:18,629
hanging off these boys' hips here?

1482
02:00:23,342 --> 02:00:25,761
- Thank you ever so much.
- Doctor.

1483
02:00:30,308 --> 02:00:31,684
Where were we?

1484
02:00:36,147 --> 02:00:37,565
Jackass.

1485
02:00:41,569 --> 02:00:43,070
Ah, yes.

1486
02:00:43,237 --> 02:00:45,990
I do believe you were
just getting ready to make me

1487
02:00:46,157 --> 02:00:48,618
a proposition to buy Broomhilda.

1488
02:00:48,784 --> 02:00:50,161
Am I right?

1489
02:00:54,165 --> 02:00:55,499
Right.

1490
02:00:57,919 --> 02:00:59,420
Bring out Hildi!

1491
02:01:02,173 --> 02:01:03,716
Get over there yonder.

1492
02:01:05,176 --> 02:01:07,428
Sit your ass in that goddamn...

1493
02:01:07,595 --> 02:01:08,846
Lay your hand
flat on that tabletop.

1494
02:01:09,013 --> 02:01:10,556
Now shut your mouth!

1495
02:01:14,852 --> 02:01:17,438
Dr. Schultz, in Greenville,

1496
02:01:17,605 --> 02:01:20,358
you yourself said that
for the right nigger

1497
02:01:20,524 --> 02:01:24,862
you'd be willin' to pay what some
may consider is a ridiculous amount.

1498
02:01:25,029 --> 02:01:28,074
To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?"

1499
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:32,203
To which you said, "$12,000."

1500
02:01:32,995 --> 02:01:34,747
Now, considering y'all

1501
02:01:34,914 --> 02:01:36,874
have ridden a whole lot of miles,

1502
02:01:37,041 --> 02:01:41,003
went through a whole lot of trouble,
and done spread a whole lot of bull

1503
02:01:41,170 --> 02:01:43,589
to purchase this
lovely lady right here,

1504
02:01:43,756 --> 02:01:49,720
it would appear that Broomhilda is,
in fact... the right nigger.

1505
02:01:49,887 --> 02:01:53,641
And if y'all want to leave
Candyland with Broomhilda,

1506
02:01:53,808 --> 02:01:59,438
the price is $12,000.

1507
02:01:59,605 --> 02:02:03,401
And I take it you prefer the "take it
or leave it" style of negotiation?

1508
02:02:05,653 --> 02:02:07,196
Yes, I do, doctor.

1509
02:02:08,030 --> 02:02:11,033
You see,
under the laws of Chickasaw County,

1510
02:02:11,200 --> 02:02:14,745
Broomhilda here is my property.

1511
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:20,042
And I can choose to do with
my property whatever I so desire!

1512
02:02:21,127 --> 02:02:23,421
And if y'all think my price...

1513
02:02:24,088 --> 02:02:26,799
...for this nigger here
is too steep...

1514
02:02:26,966 --> 02:02:30,428
...what I'm gonna desire to do is...

1515
02:02:34,348 --> 02:02:37,476
...take this goddamn hammer here
and beat her ass to death with it!

1516
02:02:37,643 --> 02:02:39,770
- Right in front of both y'all!
- Easy, big fella.

1517
02:02:39,937 --> 02:02:44,442
Then we can examine the three dimples
inside Broomhilda's skull!

1518
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,779
Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
Huh?

1519
02:02:48,946 --> 02:02:50,281
What's it gonna be?

1520
02:02:50,448 --> 02:02:54,326
May I lift the hands off the tabletop
in order to remove my billfold?

1521
02:02:55,536 --> 02:02:56,871
Yes, you may.

1522
02:03:10,634 --> 02:03:11,844
That 12.

1523
02:03:15,890 --> 02:03:17,767
Sold!

1524
02:03:17,933 --> 02:03:20,478
To the man with the exceptional beard

1525
02:03:20,644 --> 02:03:23,981
and his unexceptional nigger.

1526
02:03:29,820 --> 02:03:32,114
- Mr. Moguy.
- Yes, Calvin?

1527
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:35,951
Will you make these gentlemen
a receipt for $12,000, please?

1528
02:03:36,118 --> 02:03:37,870
$12,000.

1529
02:03:40,998 --> 02:03:43,167
It was a pleasure doing
business with y'all.

1530
02:03:44,043 --> 02:03:45,795
Now, gentlemen...

1531
02:03:47,004 --> 02:03:48,881
...if you care to
join me in the parlor...

1532
02:03:49,840 --> 02:03:52,301
...we will be serving white cake.

1533
02:05:20,639 --> 02:05:21,974
Well done, Calvin.

1534
02:05:24,476 --> 02:05:27,354
Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am?

1535
02:05:28,814 --> 02:05:32,484
Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
Take your hands off the harp!

1536
02:05:36,739 --> 02:05:37,823
Doctor!

1537
02:05:37,990 --> 02:05:40,618
- Doctor, you can't go in there!
- Stephen, Stephen.

1538
02:05:40,784 --> 02:05:41,952
He ain't got no business
going in there.

1539
02:05:42,119 --> 02:05:43,454
Let it be.

1540
02:05:43,621 --> 02:05:45,539
He's just a little upset, that's all.

1541
02:05:45,706 --> 02:05:47,124
I'll handle this.

1542
02:06:12,983 --> 02:06:14,276
White cake?

1543
02:06:15,277 --> 02:06:17,529
I don't go in for sweets, thank you.

1544
02:06:18,572 --> 02:06:19,782
Hm.

1545
02:06:27,498 --> 02:06:30,209
You brooding about me
getting the best of you, huh?

1546
02:06:30,918 --> 02:06:35,673
Actually, I was thinking of that
poor devil you fed to the dogs today.

1547
02:06:35,839 --> 02:06:37,675
D'Artagnan.

1548
02:06:38,467 --> 02:06:42,263
And I was wondering what
Dumas would make of all this.

1549
02:06:42,429 --> 02:06:43,889
Come again?

1550
02:06:46,976 --> 02:06:51,021
Alexandre Dumas.
<i>He wrote The Three Musketeers.</i>

1551
02:06:51,188 --> 02:06:52,856
Yes, of course, doctor.

1552
02:06:53,023 --> 02:06:54,566
I figured you must be an admirer.

1553
02:06:54,733 --> 02:06:59,154
You named your slave
after his novel's lead character.

1554
02:06:59,321 --> 02:07:03,033
Now, if Alexandre Dumas
had been there today,

1555
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,160
I wonder what
he would have made of it.

1556
02:07:07,204 --> 02:07:09,039
You doubt he'd approve, huh?

1557
02:07:11,250 --> 02:07:16,422
Yes. His approval would be
a dubious proposition at best.

1558
02:07:18,716 --> 02:07:20,509
Soft-hearted Frenchie.

1559
02:07:22,386 --> 02:07:24,596
Alexandre Dumas is black.

1560
02:07:28,434 --> 02:07:31,228
- Are these Broomhilda's papers?
- Yes, they are.

1561
02:07:31,395 --> 02:07:33,063
- May I?
- Of course.

1562
02:07:33,230 --> 02:07:34,606
Thank you.

1563
02:07:36,734 --> 02:07:39,695
That is her bill of sale,
her ownership history,

1564
02:07:39,862 --> 02:07:42,031
and, of course,
her freedom papers, doctor.

1565
02:07:42,197 --> 02:07:44,408
Would you have ink and pen for me?

1566
02:07:45,659 --> 02:07:48,579
- Right over there on that little table.
- Thank you.

1567
02:08:09,892 --> 02:08:11,101
Thank you.

1568
02:08:14,688 --> 02:08:16,982
Broomhilda Von Shaft...

1569
02:08:19,234 --> 02:08:21,612
...consider yourself a free woman.

1570
02:08:33,540 --> 02:08:35,501
Mr. Candie...

1571
02:08:37,461 --> 02:08:41,256
...normally,
I would say auf Wiedersehen.

1572
02:08:41,423 --> 02:08:45,886
But since what auf Wiedersehen actually
means is "till I see you again"

1573
02:08:46,053 --> 02:08:48,389
and since I never
wish to see you again,

1574
02:08:48,555 --> 02:08:53,227
to you, sir... I say, "goodbye."

1575
02:08:57,106 --> 02:08:58,399
Let's go.

1576
02:08:59,358 --> 02:09:00,901
Come on.

1577
02:09:02,611 --> 02:09:04,696
One more moment, doctor!

1578
02:09:06,573 --> 02:09:07,616
What?

1579
02:09:12,329 --> 02:09:14,456
It's a custom here in the South...

1580
02:09:14,957 --> 02:09:20,337
...once a business deal is concluded
that the two parties shake hands.

1581
02:09:21,171 --> 02:09:23,215
It implies good faith.

1582
02:09:23,382 --> 02:09:26,427
- I'm not from the South.
- But you are...

1583
02:09:26,593 --> 02:09:28,887
...in my house, doctor.

1584
02:09:29,763 --> 02:09:32,683
- So I'm afraid I must insist.
- Insist?

1585
02:09:32,850 --> 02:09:34,852
On what?
That I shake your hand?

1586
02:09:35,018 --> 02:09:38,313
Oh, then I'm afraid
I must insist in the opposite direction.

1587
02:09:38,939 --> 02:09:41,942
- You know what I think you are?
- What you think I am?

1588
02:09:42,109 --> 02:09:43,902
No, I don't.

1589
02:09:45,571 --> 02:09:50,784
- I think you are a bad loser.
- And I think you're an abysmal winner.

1590
02:09:50,951 --> 02:09:55,914
Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw
County, a deal ain't done

1591
02:09:56,081 --> 02:09:58,709
until the two parties
have shook hands.

1592
02:09:59,585 --> 02:10:02,421
Even after all that paper signin',
don't mean shit...

1593
02:10:03,380 --> 02:10:06,884
...you don't shake my hand.

1594
02:10:07,843 --> 02:10:13,515
If I don't shake your hand,
you're gonna throw away $12,000?

1595
02:10:13,682 --> 02:10:15,434
I don't think so.

1596
02:10:16,435 --> 02:10:17,603
Mr. Pooch?

1597
02:10:19,438 --> 02:10:24,151
If she tries to leave here before this
nigger-loving German shakes my hand,

1598
02:10:24,318 --> 02:10:26,069
you cut her ass down.

1599
02:10:48,091 --> 02:10:51,428
You really want me to shake your hand?

1600
02:10:53,096 --> 02:10:54,681
I insist.

1601
02:10:55,766 --> 02:10:58,435
If you insist.

1602
02:11:15,035 --> 02:11:18,038
No! Calvin!

1603
02:11:19,122 --> 02:11:20,707
Calvin!

1604
02:11:27,047 --> 02:11:29,550
I'm sorry. I couldn't resist.

1605
02:11:41,812 --> 02:11:43,981
Ni99er's gone crazy! Help!

1606
02:11:44,147 --> 02:11:45,941
Help, he's killing everyone!

1607
02:11:51,905 --> 02:11:52,948
Ah!

1608
02:12:03,000 --> 02:12:04,126
Holy...!

1609
02:12:04,293 --> 02:12:06,503
Shit! Son of a bitch!

1610
02:12:10,674 --> 02:12:11,883
Damn it! Fuckin'...!

1611
02:12:12,050 --> 02:12:14,386
Get the...!

1612
02:12:16,388 --> 02:12:17,848
Damn it, son of a bitch!

1613
02:12:18,015 --> 02:12:19,558
What...? Fucking...

1614
02:12:19,725 --> 02:12:21,351
Goddamn it!

1615
02:12:22,686 --> 02:12:24,980
What the fuck is going on?

1616
02:12:25,147 --> 02:12:27,107
You shot me!

1617
02:12:27,274 --> 02:12:30,360
- You stupid son of a bitch!
- Sorry, Jessie!

1618
02:12:30,527 --> 02:12:34,656
Who the fuck gave a nigger
a goddamn gun?

1619
02:13:04,686 --> 02:13:05,812
Aim low!

1620
02:13:08,148 --> 02:13:09,983
Nigger! Gonna kill...!

1621
02:13:10,942 --> 02:13:13,111
God! Oh, my God!

1622
02:13:13,278 --> 02:13:15,238
Motherfucker!

1623
02:13:24,081 --> 02:13:25,248
Shit!

1624
02:14:22,222 --> 02:14:23,306
Shit.

1625
02:14:35,485 --> 02:14:36,903
Hold your fire!

1626
02:14:40,323 --> 02:14:41,825
Hold your fire!

1627
02:14:43,744 --> 02:14:45,620
Stop shootin', goddamn it!

1628
02:14:54,421 --> 02:14:55,756
Django!

1629
02:14:55,922 --> 02:14:57,174
What?

1630
02:15:00,385 --> 02:15:02,012
We got your woman!

1631
02:15:03,430 --> 02:15:05,932
Billy Crash here got his pistol
upside her head.

1632
02:15:06,099 --> 02:15:08,685
You don't stop all that carrying on,

1633
02:15:08,852 --> 02:15:11,897
he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.

1634
02:15:12,063 --> 02:15:16,026
And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
That there is a promise.

1635
02:15:17,652 --> 02:15:18,862
Or...

1636
02:15:19,029 --> 02:15:22,032
...you can give up,
throw your gun out...

1637
02:15:23,158 --> 02:15:25,327
- ...we won't kill Hildi.
- Horseshit!

1638
02:15:25,494 --> 02:15:29,206
Honest Injun, Django.
I swear 'fore God.

1639
02:15:30,290 --> 02:15:34,920
You give up,
ain't no harm gonna come to her.

1640
02:15:36,379 --> 02:15:38,799
And I'm supposed to believe
your black ass?

1641
02:15:38,965 --> 02:15:41,676
Personally, I don't give a good goddamn
what you believe or don't believe!

1642
02:15:41,843 --> 02:15:44,888
I believe if you don't
give up in the next ten seconds,

1643
02:15:45,055 --> 02:15:48,934
we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
Believe that!

1644
02:15:51,186 --> 02:15:54,940
Don't do it.
You give me up.

1645
02:15:55,106 --> 02:15:56,942
- Six!
- Just let me go.

1646
02:15:57,108 --> 02:15:58,652
- Seven!
- They got too much.

1647
02:15:58,819 --> 02:16:00,403
- Django.
- Eight!

1648
02:16:00,570 --> 02:16:03,073
- I love you.
- Nine!

1649
02:16:03,240 --> 02:16:05,325
- Hold it!
- No.

1650
02:16:07,327 --> 02:16:08,411
<i>L give UP-</i>

1651
02:16:09,621 --> 02:16:12,374
I can't hear you, nigger.

1652
02:16:12,541 --> 02:16:15,043
I said I give up!

1653
02:16:38,149 --> 02:16:40,694
No!

1654
02:16:41,862 --> 02:16:43,321
No!

1655
02:18:14,579 --> 02:18:17,165
Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.

1656
02:18:22,462 --> 02:18:24,589
So y'all bounty hunters, huh?

1657
02:18:25,548 --> 02:18:28,301
I knew there was something
fishy about y'all.

1658
02:18:29,302 --> 02:18:31,513
We found your wanted posters...

1659
02:18:32,097 --> 02:18:34,307
...and book of figures
in your saddlebags.

1660
02:18:35,725 --> 02:18:37,352
I got to say...

1661
02:18:38,061 --> 02:18:41,356
...I ain't never heard of
no black bounty hunter before.

1662
02:18:41,523 --> 02:18:44,567
Black boy paid to kill white men?
How'd you like that line of work?

1663
02:18:45,610 --> 02:18:48,238
Probably pretty good while it lasted,
huh?

1664
02:18:57,706 --> 02:18:59,541
Time to say good night
to them nuts, blackie.

1665
02:18:59,708 --> 02:19:02,377
On three. One...

1666
02:19:02,544 --> 02:19:05,422
I got you. Two...

1667
02:19:05,588 --> 02:19:08,800
Calm down, now, here it comes.

1668
02:19:08,967 --> 02:19:11,553
" Captain?

1669
02:19:11,720 --> 02:19:13,471
Miss Lara want to see you.

1670
02:19:14,305 --> 02:19:18,226
Something to do
with the Old Man's funeral.

1671
02:19:18,393 --> 02:19:22,188
Oh, and she changed her mind
'bout snipping Django.

1672
02:19:22,981 --> 02:19:25,817
She gonna give him
to the LeQuint Dickey people.

1673
02:19:27,652 --> 02:19:29,779
Well, she didn't
waste a minute telling me.

1674
02:19:37,037 --> 02:19:38,830
How disappointing.

1675
02:20:01,770 --> 02:20:03,104
You leavin'.

1676
02:20:04,773 --> 02:20:07,817
This here what you take with you.

1677
02:20:11,196 --> 02:20:14,657
Your black ass has been all them
motherfuckers at The Big House

1678
02:20:14,824 --> 02:20:18,244
could talk about
for the last few hours.

1679
02:20:18,411 --> 02:20:22,123
Seem like white folk ain't never
had a bright idea in they life

1680
02:20:22,290 --> 02:20:25,001
was coming up with all
kinds of ways to kill your ass.

1681
02:20:25,168 --> 02:20:30,465
Now, mind you, most of them ideas had
to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.

1682
02:20:30,632 --> 02:20:36,179
Now, that may seem like a good idea,
but truth is...

1683
02:20:37,764 --> 02:20:40,016
...when you snip a nigger's nuts,

1684
02:20:40,183 --> 02:20:44,395
most of them bleed out in,
oh, about, hm... seven minutes.

1685
02:20:44,562 --> 02:20:46,147
Most of 'em.

1686
02:20:46,356 --> 02:20:49,526
Well, more than most.

1687
02:20:50,276 --> 02:20:56,116
"Shitfire.

1688
02:20:56,282 --> 02:21:00,286
The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey
got it worse than that."

1689
02:21:01,329 --> 02:21:04,040
And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death."

1690
02:21:04,207 --> 02:21:07,502
Or "Throw him to the Mandingos."
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs."

1691
02:21:07,669 --> 02:21:10,880
And I said,
"What's so special about that?

1692
02:21:11,047 --> 02:21:13,174
We do that shit all the time.

1693
02:21:13,341 --> 02:21:19,222
Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to
LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that."

1694
02:21:20,348 --> 02:21:23,059
Lo and behold,

1695
02:21:23,226 --> 02:21:28,064
out of nowhere, Miss Lara
come up with the bright idea

1696
02:21:28,231 --> 02:21:31,693
of giving your ass to the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.

1697
02:21:34,070 --> 02:21:39,200
And as a slave of the
LeQuint Dickey Mining Company,

1698
02:21:39,367 --> 02:21:42,912
henceforth, till the day you die,

1699
02:21:43,079 --> 02:21:46,207
all day, every day,

1700
02:21:46,374 --> 02:21:49,210
you will be swinging
a sledgehammer,

1701
02:21:49,377 --> 02:21:54,007
turning big rocks into little rocks.

1702
02:21:54,174 --> 02:21:58,761
Now, when you get there,
they gonna take away your name,

1703
02:21:58,928 --> 02:22:01,848
give you a number
and a sledgehammer,

1704
02:22:02,015 --> 02:22:04,434
and say, "Get to work!"

1705
02:22:04,601 --> 02:22:07,020
One word of sass,
they cuts out your tongue.

1706
02:22:07,187 --> 02:22:09,522
And they good at it too.
You won't bleed out.

1707
02:22:09,689 --> 02:22:13,359
Oh, they does that real good.

1708
02:22:13,526 --> 02:22:15,111
They gonna work ya.

1709
02:22:15,278 --> 02:22:20,283
All day, every day,
till your back give out.

1710
02:22:20,450 --> 02:22:23,036
Then they're gonna hit you
in the head with a hammer,

1711
02:22:23,203 --> 02:22:25,622
throw your ass down the nigger hole.

1712
02:22:25,788 --> 02:22:31,169
And that will be the story of you,
Django.

1713
02:23:10,208 --> 02:23:12,669
And what's
the golden rule, Frankie, eh?

1714
02:23:12,835 --> 02:23:14,963
You don't root abos.

1715
02:23:19,717 --> 02:23:21,177
Hey, white boy.

1716
02:23:22,720 --> 02:23:24,889
I said, hey, white boy.

1717
02:23:25,056 --> 02:23:28,142
Shut up, black. You ain't got
nothing to say I want to hear.

1718
02:23:28,309 --> 02:23:30,603
How'd you like to make $11,000?

1719
02:23:30,770 --> 02:23:31,938
Do what, now?

1720
02:23:32,105 --> 02:23:37,902
I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
11,500, actually.

1721
02:23:38,069 --> 02:23:40,029
What the fuck are you talking about?

1722
02:23:40,196 --> 02:23:44,867
Back there at that plantation,
Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune,

1723
02:23:45,034 --> 02:23:47,870
just sittin' there.
And y'all rode right past it.

1724
02:23:48,830 --> 02:23:50,540
You be damned, blackie,
we're not bandits.

1725
02:23:50,707 --> 02:23:54,919
I ain't saying that. Nice thing
about this fortune is it ain't illegal.

1726
02:23:55,086 --> 02:23:56,504
You can't steal it.

1727
02:23:56,671 --> 02:23:58,339
You got to earn it, white boy.

1728
02:23:59,299 --> 02:24:01,301
You got something to say, mate,
you say it.

1729
02:24:01,467 --> 02:24:04,679
The $11,500 fortune waitin'
for you back at Candyland

1730
02:24:04,846 --> 02:24:06,973
is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty

1731
02:24:07,140 --> 02:24:09,475
on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.

1732
02:24:09,642 --> 02:24:11,102
Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?

1733
02:24:11,269 --> 02:24:14,564
Smitty Bacall is the leader of this
murderous gang of stagecoach robbers,

1734
02:24:14,731 --> 02:24:16,316
the Bacall Gang.

1735
02:24:16,482 --> 02:24:19,736
There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive" bounty on him,

1736
02:24:19,902 --> 02:24:23,239
$1,500 for each
of his three accomplices:

1737
02:24:23,406 --> 02:24:26,659
Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash,

1738
02:24:26,826 --> 02:24:29,537
and Crazy Craig Koons.

1739
02:24:29,704 --> 02:24:31,122
Now, all four of them gentlemen,

1740
02:24:31,289 --> 02:24:33,416
they back there at Candyland
laughing their ass off.

1741
02:24:33,583 --> 02:24:37,253
You know why?
'Cause they just got away with murder.

1742
02:24:37,420 --> 02:24:38,963
But it ain't got to be that way.

1743
02:24:39,130 --> 02:24:42,425
You and your mates, y'all can ride back
there and y'all can go get that money.

1744
02:24:42,592 --> 02:24:43,676
What'd these jokers do again?

1745
02:24:43,843 --> 02:24:47,347
These sons of bitches,
they killed innocent people.

1746
02:24:47,513 --> 02:24:50,767
Stagecoach robbery.
Innocent white people.

1747
02:24:51,851 --> 02:24:54,854
I got the handbill right here
in my pocket, if you let me get it.

1748
02:24:55,021 --> 02:24:56,189
Get it out.

1749
02:24:57,940 --> 02:25:03,196
"Wanted. Dead or alive. Smitty
Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang."

1750
02:25:03,363 --> 02:25:04,697
- But you're a slave.
- "For murder..."

1751
02:25:04,864 --> 02:25:07,367
- I ain't no goddamn slave.
- "...and stagecoach robbery."

1752
02:25:07,533 --> 02:25:08,785
Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?

1753
02:25:09,118 --> 02:25:10,578
- "$7,000 for Smitty Bacall."
- Hm?

1754
02:25:10,745 --> 02:25:13,539
- That's a shitload.
- I'm a bounty hunter.

1755
02:25:14,957 --> 02:25:17,543
Yesterday, as a free man,

1756
02:25:17,710 --> 02:25:22,256
I rode into Candyland on a horse
with my German white partner,

1757
02:25:22,423 --> 02:25:23,966
Dr. King Schultz.

1758
02:25:24,133 --> 02:25:28,888
We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way
from Texas to Chickasaw County.

1759
02:25:29,055 --> 02:25:31,974
We finally found their ass
layin' low in Candyland.

1760
02:25:32,141 --> 02:25:35,645
We went in there to get 'em,
things went sour,

1761
02:25:35,812 --> 02:25:39,148
my partner got killed,
Calvin Candie got shot,

1762
02:25:39,315 --> 02:25:43,486
then everybody there
decided to blame me, so here I am.

1763
02:25:45,488 --> 02:25:47,407
But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.

1764
02:25:47,573 --> 02:25:50,368
And all y'all know
I ain't supposed to be on this trip.

1765
02:25:50,535 --> 02:25:53,871
But them four men is still back there,
they're still wanted,

1766
02:25:54,038 --> 02:25:57,333
and that 11,500 is up for grabs,
and the last thing they'd expect

1767
02:25:57,500 --> 02:25:59,752
is y'all ridin' back in there
and gettin' it.

1768
02:25:59,919 --> 02:26:01,671
What's the deal?

1769
02:26:01,838 --> 02:26:05,299
You tell us who they are
and we turn you loose?

1770
02:26:05,466 --> 02:26:08,344
No, no,no, no.
I ain't gonna tell you who they are.

1771
02:26:08,511 --> 02:26:12,014
But, you give me a pistol,
one of them horses,

1772
02:26:12,181 --> 02:26:16,686
and $500 of that 11,500,
and I'll point 'em out to you.

1773
02:26:16,853 --> 02:26:18,729
This is a real handbill.

1774
02:26:18,896 --> 02:26:19,939
Now just 'cause it's a real handbill

1775
02:26:20,106 --> 02:26:22,191
doesn't mean that other
bunch of malarkey is.

1776
02:26:22,358 --> 02:26:28,281
Now why would a slave have a "Wanted
Dead or Alive" handbill in his pocket?

1777
02:26:32,952 --> 02:26:35,746
Did that black ride
into Candyland yesterday?

1778
02:26:42,086 --> 02:26:46,048
All right, I'm gonna ask you again.

1779
02:26:47,258 --> 02:26:49,886
I want you to remember,
I don't like liars.

1780
02:26:50,595 --> 02:26:52,430
Is he a Candyland slave,

1781
02:26:52,597 --> 02:26:56,392
or did he ride in with a white man
on a horse yesterday?

1782
02:26:56,559 --> 02:27:00,229
Yeah. They walked us
from the Greenville auction,

1783
02:27:00,396 --> 02:27:02,940
and he rode in on a horse
with a white man.

1784
02:27:03,608 --> 02:27:07,778
Now this white man,
was the black his slave?

1785
02:27:07,945 --> 02:27:09,447
He weren't no slave.

1786
02:27:09,614 --> 02:27:13,451
- You fuckin' sure about that?
- Damn sure.

1787
02:27:17,413 --> 02:27:20,958
- What happened over in Candyland?
- Bunch-a shootin'.

1788
02:27:21,125 --> 02:27:22,919
Massa got shot.

1789
02:27:23,085 --> 02:27:25,213
- Who shot him?
- The German.

1790
02:27:25,379 --> 02:27:26,422
Why'd he do that?

1791
02:27:27,089 --> 02:27:30,551
Nigger and the German was actin'
like they were slavers but they wasn't.

1792
02:27:30,718 --> 02:27:33,804
- Well, what were they?
- Bounty hunters.

1793
02:27:34,889 --> 02:27:38,226
Fuck me, Roy.
I mean, this could be big, mate.

1794
02:27:39,268 --> 02:27:42,480
Well, smoke, you got a deal.

1795
02:27:43,981 --> 02:27:46,817
- I got one more condition.
- What's that?

1796
02:27:46,984 --> 02:27:50,780
When we get there, when time come...

1797
02:27:52,156 --> 02:27:55,117
- ...you let me help you kill 'em.
- Hey...

1798
02:27:55,284 --> 02:27:56,953
...you're a funny bugger.

1799
02:27:57,119 --> 02:27:59,497
- Cut him loose.
- Yeah, yeah.

1800
02:27:59,664 --> 02:28:01,457
You got yourself a deal, blackie.

1801
02:28:01,624 --> 02:28:03,793
You got yourself a deal, mate.

1802
02:28:03,960 --> 02:28:05,670
Hey!

1803
02:28:05,836 --> 02:28:07,171
You're all right for a black fella.

1804
02:28:07,338 --> 02:28:08,589
Oh, yeah.

1805
02:28:13,803 --> 02:28:15,471
There we go.
There you go, mate.

1806
02:28:15,638 --> 02:28:17,014
Yeah.

1807
02:28:17,181 --> 02:28:19,850
We're gonna give you
that packhorse over there.

1808
02:28:20,017 --> 02:28:21,978
What them saddlebags got in 'em?

1809
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:24,021
- Dynamite.
- No. I ain't ridin' no horse

1810
02:28:24,188 --> 02:28:26,107
with no goddamn dynamite on its back.

1811
02:28:26,274 --> 02:28:28,150
I can understand that.

1812
02:28:28,317 --> 02:28:31,153
Frankie, why don't you
take them sticks off that horse

1813
02:28:31,320 --> 02:28:33,155
and stick 'em in the nigger cage.

1814
02:28:34,782 --> 02:28:36,951
A little dynamite for you
black fellas to play with.

1815
02:28:48,504 --> 02:28:51,173
Now, Floyd, you got that
rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?

1816
02:28:51,340 --> 02:28:52,341
Yeah, right.

1817
02:28:52,508 --> 02:28:55,052
Why don't you give him
your gun and gun belt?

1818
02:28:55,219 --> 02:28:56,512
Righto.

1819
02:28:56,679 --> 02:28:59,807
Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing,
all right?

1820
02:28:59,974 --> 02:29:02,893
I've just had the sights fixed
and they're perfect.

1821
02:29:03,060 --> 02:29:04,186
Oh, that's good to know.

1822
02:30:36,570 --> 02:30:38,280
Throw me up that dynamite.

1823
02:32:08,704 --> 02:32:10,331
- Jake!
- Yeah?

1824
02:32:10,498 --> 02:32:13,876
Get out there and see what's
wrong with them goddamn dogs!

1825
02:32:18,672 --> 02:32:20,633
D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!

1826

02:37:19,098 --> 02:37:20,974
Oh, no!

1853
02:37:22,976 --> 02:37:25,687
Now, all you black folks,

1854
02:37:25,854 --> 02:37:29,233
I suggest you get away
from all these white folks.

1855
02:37:30,192 --> 02:37:31,860
Not you, Stephen.

1856
02:37:32,402 --> 02:37:34,571
You right where you belong.

1857
02:37:36,949 --> 02:37:41,370
Cora, before you go,
will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?

1858
02:37:41,537 --> 02:37:46,375
- Do what now?
- I said, "Tell Miss Lara goodbye."

1859
02:37:48,001 --> 02:37:50,212
Bye, Miss Lara.

1860
02:37:53,966 --> 02:37:55,134
Y'all two run along now.

1861
02:38:13,694 --> 02:38:18,157
Stephen, how you like my new duds?

1862
02:38:19,158 --> 02:38:21,743
You know, before now I didn't know
that burgundy was my color.

1863
02:38:33,380 --> 02:38:35,299
I count six shots, nigger.

1864
02:38:36,758 --> 02:38:38,594
I count two guns, nigger.

1865
02:38:42,598 --> 02:38:44,433
You said in 76 years on this plantation,

1866
02:38:44,600 --> 02:38:47,227
you seen all manner-a shit
done to niggers.

1867
02:38:47,394 --> 02:38:50,439
But I notice,
you didn't mention kneecappin'.

1868
02:38:50,898 --> 02:38:54,067
Oh, God! Motherfucker! Damn it!

1869
02:38:54,234 --> 02:38:56,111
Seventy-six years, Stephen.

1870
02:38:56,278 --> 02:38:57,946
How many niggers you think
you see come and go, huh?

1871
02:38:58,113 --> 02:38:59,698
Seven thousand?

1872
02:38:59,865 --> 02:39:01,575
Eight thousand?

1873
02:39:01,742 --> 02:39:03,452
Nine thousand?

1874
02:39:03,619 --> 02:39:06,413
Nine thousand, nine hundred
and ninety-nine?

1875
02:39:06,580 --> 02:39:08,957
Every single word that came
out of Calvin Candie's mouth

1876
02:39:09,124 --> 02:39:10,459
was nothin' but horseshit.

1877
02:39:10,626 --> 02:39:14,463
I am that one nigger in 10,000.

1878
02:39:17,299 --> 02:39:19,051
You son of a bitch!

1879
02:39:19,218 --> 02:39:21,970
You motherfucker!

1880
02:39:22,137 --> 02:39:24,431
Oh, sweet Jesus,
let me kill this nigger!

1881
02:39:26,016 --> 02:39:28,977
You ain't gonna get away with this,
Django!

1882
02:39:29,144 --> 02:39:31,146
They gonna catch your black ass.

1883
02:39:31,313 --> 02:39:33,607
You gonna be on the
wanted posters now, nigger.

1884
02:39:33,774 --> 02:39:36,610
The bounty hunters
gonna be lookin' for you.

1885
02:39:36,777 --> 02:39:41,031
You can run, nigger,
but they gonna find your ass!

1886
02:39:41,198 --> 02:39:45,118
And when they do, oh, Lord,
what they gonna do to your ass!

1887
02:39:45,285 --> 02:39:47,996
They ain't gonna just kill you, nigger!

1888
02:39:48,163 --> 02:39:49,915
You done fucked up!

1889
02:39:50,082 --> 02:39:52,167
This Candyland, nigger!

1890
02:39:52,334 --> 02:39:55,045
You can't destroy Candyland!

1891
02:39:55,212 --> 02:39:58,840
We been here!
There's always gonna be a Candyland!

1892
02:40:09,851 --> 02:40:13,397
Can't no nigger gunfighter
kill all the white folks in the world!

1893
02:40:13,563 --> 02:40:16,191
They gonna find your black ass!

1894
02:40:20,737 --> 02:40:23,323
Django!

1895
02:40:23,490 --> 02:40:25,867
You uppity son of a...

1896
02:41:00,652 --> 02:41:02,195
Hey, Little Trouble Maker.

1897
02:41:02,863 --> 02:41:04,781
Hey, Big Trouble Maker.

1898
02:41:32,100 --> 02:41:36,730
You know what they are going to call
you? "The fastest gun in the South."

1899
02:41:44,363 --> 02:41:45,947
Let's get outta here.

1900
02:45:14,823 --> 02:45:16,366
Who was that nigger?
