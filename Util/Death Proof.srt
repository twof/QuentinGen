1
00:02:56,709 --> 00:02:58,404
Hold on, I gotta come up!

2
00:02:58,478 --> 00:03:00,708
I've gotta take
the world's biggest fucking piss.

3
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,645
We can't be late!

4
00:03:02,715 --> 00:03:04,308
We won't!

5
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,235
Who's... who's holding?

6
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:30,936
If you 're not, then nobody.

7
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,739
We were kind of hoping you were.

8
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:35,303
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.

9
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:38,475
It is not my fucking job to supply y'all
with weed when we go out.

10
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,746
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, little lady.

11
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,811
You're gettin' angry kind of quick,
don't you think?

12
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,083
I was just teasin' you!

13
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:45,590
I'm not angry.
It just would be nice

14
00:03:45,658 --> 00:03:48,388
if y'all didn't just count on me
all the fucking time

15
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,294
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

16
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,332
Okay, mean girl
in a high school movie.

17
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,764
Are you through
having a tantrum?

18
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,028
I'm not having a tantrum.

19
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,366
Yes, you are. You've been
in the car all of two seconds,

20
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,598
and you're already cursing at me.

21
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,435
I am not cursing at you.

22
00:04:01,507 --> 00:04:05,603
You said "Jesus Christ, Shanna,"

23
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:07,168
and then before
the sentence was over

24
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:10,114
you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your irritatedness.

25
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,515
Come on, don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

26
00:04:12,585 --> 00:04:16,612
One, it is not about the money.
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

27
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,850
And two, we're not really fighting.

28
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:22,588
Arlene, you've forgotten what
hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.

29
00:04:22,662 --> 00:04:23,890
That wasn't a fight.

30
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:26,523
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch

31
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,467
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

32
00:04:30,536 --> 00:04:33,528
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.

33
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,595
Oh! Billboard!

34
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,946
So, what's the plan, man?

35
00:04:41,014 --> 00:04:42,982
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

36
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,914
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?

37
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,417
- Of course.
- You 're so good.

38
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,680
I know.

39
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,222
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

40
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,952
You bet your ass he is...
with Jesse Letterman.

41
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:56,052
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

42
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:57,562
He's got a big thing for Julia.

43
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,894
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me,

44
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,627
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

45
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,965
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does.

46
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,767
And on my birthday
he'd give me a fucking phone call.

47
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,033
Oh, billboard!

48
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,211
Yeah, but you get
those legs of yours around him,

49
00:05:18,284 --> 00:05:19,342
and it's all over.

50
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,980
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills that I am also living in,

51
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:24,523
I'll let you know it worked.

52
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,150
So, margaritas
and Mexican food at Guero's,

53
00:05:27,226 --> 00:05:29,194
touch base with Chris and Jesse,
tell them about later,

54
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,355
and make damn sure they come.

55
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:34,594
Those other guys'll be waiting for us
at the Texas Chili Parlor.

56
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:38,125
Oh, shit. Speaking of which...

57
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:40,001
what happened
with you and Nate last night?

58
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,769
Well, you know, not much.
We just fucking met each other.

59
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:45,675
If you don't bust their balls a little bit,
they're never gonna respect you.

60
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:48,111
Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

61
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,376
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

62
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,475
Oh, nothing to write home about.

63
00:05:52,552 --> 00:05:54,952
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

64
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:56,511
Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?

65
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:59,319
Dressed. I said we made out.
We didn't do "the thing."

66
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,793
Oh, excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

67
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,693
You know, it's everything but.

68
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:06,493
They call that "the thing"?

69
00:06:06,566 --> 00:06:08,124
I call it "the thing."

70
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,158
Do guys like "the thing"?

71
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,931
They like it better than "no thing."

72
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:16,207
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.

73
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:17,833
So you're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

74
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,899
Correct.

75
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,468
Whose couch?
His or the one in your hotel room?

76
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:22,980
What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

77
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:25,074
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

78
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,585
We started sitting up,
we worked our way to lying down.

79
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:30,747
Hmm. The plot thickens.
Who was on top?

80
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,654
I was straddling him.

81
00:06:33,459 --> 00:06:34,448
What else?

82
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,496
That was it. So we made out
for a little while on the couch...

83
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:42,364
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave."

84
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,199
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"

85
00:06:45,271 --> 00:06:48,365
And I said,
"Yup, right now. Let's go."

86
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,001
And he says, "Wait, what about this?"
And I said no.

87
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,011
He said, "What do you mean?
You don't know what I'm gonna say."

88
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:56,207
I said, "I already know what you're
gonna say, and the answer's no."

89
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:57,977
He said, "Well, how can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"

90
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,575
And I said, "Because you're gonna say,
'Let's just go to sleep together.

91
00:07:00,653 --> 00:07:01,950
'We don't gotta do nothing.

92
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:04,080
'Just cuddle,
sleep next to each other,

93
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,022
wake up in the morning together.'"

94
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:09,459
"No. You 're gonna leave...
but I'll see you tomorrow."

95
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,791
Yeah, fuck Nate.

96
00:07:10,863 --> 00:07:11,887
I mean, he's cute and all,

97
00:07:11,964 --> 00:07:14,899
but Jesse Letterman
is gonna be all over her.

98
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:18,300
Remember...
no hookin' up tonight.

99
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:21,932
You can hang out with them,
you can make out with them,

100
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,999
but no hookin' up with them,

101
00:07:24,076 --> 00:07:27,409
because we are driving
to Lake L.B.J. tonight,

102
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,448
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing...

103
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:34,612
He said, "I am lettin' you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,

104
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:38,817
not you and a bunch of horny boys
trying to get their fuck on with my daughter."

105
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,223
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell yeah.

106
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,558
And it's not like
he ain't gonna know, either,

107
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,258
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,

108
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:51,394
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.

109
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:56,468
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear!

110
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:59,238
But you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang

111
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,610
walking the floor of his lake house,

112
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:05,082
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.

113
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,709
And if you flirt shamelessly with him,

114
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:09,346
like the six-foot baby giraffe
in the backseat,

115
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:11,447
you got a puppy dog for life.

116
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:13,082
I have my own relationship with Ben,

117
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:15,059
and you're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.

118
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:16,424
You call her dad "Ben"?

119
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,828
I'm not a child.
That's his name.

120
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:20,866
So, when are the boys
showing up?

121
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:23,094
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.

122
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,693
Maybe they can bring some pot.

123
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,237
Fuck that. No.

124
00:08:26,305 --> 00:08:28,603
I don't wanna be either A,
depending on their fucking ass,

125
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,107
or B, depending on their ass.

126
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,438
Uh-uh. If we don't score ourselves,

127
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:34,139
we're gonna be stuck with them
all fucking night.

128
00:08:34,213 --> 00:08:36,340
Ooh! Try Lanna-Frank.

129
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:38,110
Best idea you had all day.

130
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:41,210
Oh, hey! That's your
last billboard before Guero's!

131
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:43,278
Oh, come on, give me a break.

132
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,950
Oh, come on, my ass!
We said every time.

133
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,049
Okay.

134
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,302
Jules, let me get a drag.

135
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,638
Thanks.

136
00:09:35,441 --> 00:09:36,430
Oh, my God.

137
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:39,710
Hey, this is...
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.

138
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:40,768
Hey.

139
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,440
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.

140
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,482
Ooh...

141
00:09:45,551 --> 00:09:47,712
So, you must be... must be...

142
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:50,585
So, you must be
the infamous Butterfly.

143
00:09:50,656 --> 00:09:51,884
Shh!

144
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,858
She don't know nothing about it.

145
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,757
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?

146
00:09:55,828 --> 00:09:56,920
- Soon.
- Tell me what?

147
00:09:56,996 --> 00:09:59,726
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we've gotta tell her sooner than later.

148
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,391
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

149
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:04,129
I said a little something-something
about you on the air today.

150
00:10:04,203 --> 00:10:06,398
Julia, what the fuck
did you say about me on the radio?

151
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,908
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

152
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,001
who was in from out-of-town
for the weekend,

153
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,706
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

154
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,180
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.

155
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,845
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

156
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:24,890
if they'd do something,
you'd do something.

157
00:10:24,957 --> 00:10:26,254
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

158
00:10:26,325 --> 00:10:28,725
What did you say
and what did you say I'd do?

159
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:32,730
Anywho, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

160
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:35,460
or Marcy over here,

161
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,094
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

162
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,266
which I think will give you a better idea
what you have in store for you tonight.

163
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,400
Okay, so just tell me your way.

164
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,468
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

165
00:10:46,545 --> 00:10:48,740
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

166
00:10:49,982 --> 00:10:53,440
Okay, so you 're
in a club or a bar,

167
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,579
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

168
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:58,385
or better be
fucking hysterically funny,

169
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:01,187
but not-funny-looking guy
who you could fuck.

170
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,488
Got it.

171
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,324
Okay, Marcy, take it.

172
00:11:13,139 --> 00:11:14,436
Howdy.

173
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,805
Hi, there.

174
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:19,572
Excuse me, but...

175
00:11:19,645 --> 00:11:21,704
your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly," would it?

176
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:25,683
Yes, it is, and it seems
you have me at a disadvantage.

177
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:27,184
Barry.

178
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,948
Pleased to meet you, Barry.

179
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,488
Y'all are gettin' me hot!

180
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,682
Shh!

181
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,024
So is, uh...
"Butterfly" your real name?

182
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:40,827
Yes, it is.

183
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,834
And how'd you know
my name, Barry?

184
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,700
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this mornin'.

185
00:11:45,771 --> 00:11:46,897
Oh, you did, did you?

186
00:11:46,972 --> 00:11:49,304
Oh, yeah, I listen to her show
every morning.

187
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,400
Oh, you do, do you?

188
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:54,469
Yeah, she's like
the coolest lady in town.

189
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,015
Don't you think
she's got a big ass?

190
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,484
Nah, man!
I like her ass that way.

191
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,521
She got a black girl's ass.

192
00:12:02,588 --> 00:12:04,249
Well, that's what she always says,

193
00:12:04,323 --> 00:12:07,190
but in actual fact, she doesn't
really have a black girl's ass.

194
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:09,250
She's got a big ass.

195
00:12:09,328 --> 00:12:10,727
Okay, what the fuck
are you doing?

196
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:12,661
Look who wants
to get to the point all of a sudden.

197
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,926
Okay, we'll get to the point,

198
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:15,899
but for your information,
skinny bitch,

199
00:12:15,968 --> 00:12:19,062
black men and a whole lot
of motherfuckin' white men

200
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:21,698
have had plenty of fun
adoring my ass.

201
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,902
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

202
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:27,411
If you're not gonna buy me a drink,
can I have mine back?

203
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,846
No, okay, okay, okay, okay.

204
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,246
So, Butterfly...

205
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,807
can I buy you a drink?

206
00:12:32,885 --> 00:12:34,216
I'd love one.

207
00:12:34,286 --> 00:12:35,275
What can I get ya?

208
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:36,946
I'll take a margarita.

209
00:12:38,357 --> 00:12:39,449
Here ya go.

210
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,627
So, after they buy you a drink

211
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,095
when they raise
their glass to toast,

212
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:50,158
they look you dead in the eye
and repeat this poem...

213
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:54,605
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep

214
00:12:54,673 --> 00:12:59,838
And I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep."

215
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:01,777
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

216
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:04,816
"Miles to go before you sleep."

217
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:08,513
And then, if they say that...

218
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:11,186
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

219
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:12,884
What?

220
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,449
If they call you "Butterfly,"
buy you a drink, repeat that poem,

221
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,517
you gotta give 'em a lap dance.

222
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:18,495
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothin'.

223
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,191
Well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

224
00:13:20,266 --> 00:13:22,564
everybody in Austin
is gonna think you a chicken shit.

225
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,159
And I don't think you want
everybody in Austin

226
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:25,760
thinking you're a chicken shit.

227
00:13:25,838 --> 00:13:27,999
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

228
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,098
Oh, come on!
It's gonna be funny!

229
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,940
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.

230
00:13:33,012 --> 00:13:36,209
Look. You don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

231
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:38,250
I said you'd do it
for the first guy who says it.

232
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:41,343
So, some geek comes over
trying to be cool,

233
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,321
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

234
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:48,121
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

235
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:50,754
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

236
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,354
you've had a few drinks,

237
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,626
you're kind of loosey-goosey,

238
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,497
you're safe with your girls,

239
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,299
then some kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

240
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:03,171
hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy
comes up and says it...

241
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:07,338
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

242
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,410
She's making me trip.

243
00:14:14,486 --> 00:14:18,923
Shut the fuck up.
You made me trip, dumb bitch!

244
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,964
You fuckin' idiot!

245
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:02,992
<i># Baby #</i>

246
00:15:20,452 --> 00:15:25,253
<i># It doesn't matter
what they say #</i>

247
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:28,885
<i># I know I'm gonna love you
any old way #</i>

248
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:35,230
<i># What can I do without you? #</i>

249
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:40,796
<i># Don't want nobody, nobody #</i>

250
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:44,036
<i># Baby, it's you #</i>

251
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,844
<i># Baby, it's you #</i>

252
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:54,517
<i># Don't leave me alone #</i>

253
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:59,622

254
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:04,420
<i># Baby, it's you #</i>

255
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,866
<i># Baby, it's you... #</i>

256
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,899
Any dead soldiers here?

257
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,997
Uh, these two. Thank you.

258
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:18,367
Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?

259
00:16:18,444 --> 00:16:21,538
That's a good fucking question.

260
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,353
Lanna-Frank!

261
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,549
Where are you?

262
00:16:37,463 --> 00:16:39,590
Well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.

263
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:42,930
- Shit! Hold on!

264
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:56,706
So, where are you?

265
00:16:57,883 --> 00:16:59,908
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

266
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,945
No. We're not coming over there.

267
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,185
You come over here
like you said you would.

268
00:17:06,258 --> 00:17:09,250
So, is it Shauna and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

269
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,796
- Shauna?
- Oh, fuck. I...

270
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:12,853
No.

271
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:15,866
Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

272
00:17:15,934 --> 00:17:18,767
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other.

273
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,395
We all hate the name "Shauna,"

274
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:22,906
and we really hate it
when people call us "Shauna."

275
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:01,374
Just remember...

276
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,109
it's "Shanna Banana,"
not "Shauna Banauna."

277
00:18:04,183 --> 00:18:07,380
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

278
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:10,786
Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but...

279
00:18:37,549 --> 00:18:41,542
Okay... Warren's sending over shots,
and you know the house rules.

280
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,316
If he sends over shots,
you gotta do them.

281
00:18:44,389 --> 00:18:46,755
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

282
00:18:46,825 --> 00:18:50,352
- Warren says it, we do it!
I love that philosophy!

283
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,829
"Warren says it, we do it."

284
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,866
So let's do it!

285
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:55,991
What is it?

286
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:00,027
Hey, shot first, questions later.
Here we go. Post time!

287
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:02,503
Mmm!

288
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:06,434
Whoo-hoo!

289
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:13,882
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

290
00:19:13,952 --> 00:19:15,214
What the fuck is it?!

291
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:16,879
Chartreuse.

292
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:20,152
The only liquor so good
they named a color after it.

293
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,619
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?

294
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,959
Not me.

295
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:27,828
I'm going out for a smoke.

296
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,300
Okay, but careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

297
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,893
You 'll blow up the joint.

298
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,615
Drinks.
What can we get you?

299
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:47,777
Shanna Banana?

300
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:50,413
Another big-ass
Long Island iced tea.

301
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:53,458
Bombay Sapphire
and tonic with no ice.

302
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,254
Good boy.

303
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:17,938
Oh, hey, Punky.

304
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:20,780
Uh, one of the lights
is off in the parking lot. Flip it.

305
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:56,851
- Oh! Jesus Christ!
- Whoa-ho!

306
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:00,083
You scared the fuck out of me,
you shitty asshole!

307
00:21:00,158 --> 00:21:02,683
I swear, Arlene.
I was not trying to scare you.

308
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,592
I just... got lucky.

309
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,460
Oh, hardee-fucking-har.

310
00:21:06,531 --> 00:21:07,862
- Let's go inside.
- Wait a minute.

311
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,800
- Why?
- I was thinkin' we could make out.

312
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:11,858
What, on a porch?

313
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,802
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?

314
00:21:13,872 --> 00:21:15,897
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.

315
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:18,568
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.

316
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,236
Not in my car it's not.

317
00:21:20,846 --> 00:21:22,871
Look, you won't get wet.

318
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:25,109
I promise you.

319
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,577
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.

320
00:21:29,655 --> 00:21:31,384
Ha ha ha.

321
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,253
I mean...
you know what I mean.

322
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:35,316
Look, I know you guys
are going to Lake L.B.J.

323
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,725
and we can't come.

324
00:21:37,896 --> 00:21:39,488
I wanna make out...

325
00:21:39,564 --> 00:21:42,362
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.

326
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:52,342
I don't want it super fucking obvious
to everybody in the bar we've been gone,

327
00:21:52,411 --> 00:21:56,006
- so we'll make out for six minutes, deal?
- Great.

328
00:21:56,081 --> 00:21:57,378
No, no, no.
Deal or no deal?

329
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,644
If you're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,

330
00:21:59,718 --> 00:22:02,016
we could just walk back
inside the fucking bar right now.

331
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:03,645
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.

332
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,156
And no begging.
When you say "done," it's done.

333
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:08,192
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

334
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,420
Okay, let's go.

335
00:22:11,863 --> 00:22:15,663
Oh, you got two jobs... kiss good
and make sure my hair don't get wet.

336
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,953
<i># It was early, early one morning #</i>

337
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:43,085
<i># When I heard my bulldog bark #</i>

338
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,426
<i># It was Staggolee and Billy Lyons #</i>

339
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:48,489
<i># Squabblin ' in the dark... #</i>

340
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,127
Now, look, you can't look like
you're trying to get her out of here

341
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,568
before Christian Simonson shows up,

342
00:22:52,637 --> 00:22:55,265
but you've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

343
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,329
Yeah, but what's the point?

344
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:58,376
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake L.B.J.,

345
00:22:58,443 --> 00:22:59,603
and it's no guys.

346
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:01,236
Absolutely no guys.

347
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:03,907
Okay. So after we bring
the girls' drinks,

348
00:23:03,982 --> 00:23:08,715
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

349
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,255
You think they're gonna fall for that?

350
00:23:11,323 --> 00:23:13,814
We'll be very convincing.

351
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,521
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

352
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,153
We go to Jäger shots.

353
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:21,390
Man, they're not gonna drink Jäger shots.

354
00:23:21,466 --> 00:23:22,956
Dude, as long as
a guy's buying the booze,

355
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:25,059
a fucking bitch
will drink anything.

356
00:23:25,137 --> 00:23:26,468
Come on, dude, we can
at least get one shot of Jäger

357
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,199
down these
fucking bitches' throats.

358
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:30,366
After that, we'll see if they get
another Jäger shot in them.

359
00:23:30,442 --> 00:23:31,431
You never know.

360
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,910
That could be the shot
that puts them past the point of "fuck it."

361
00:23:33,979 --> 00:23:35,776
Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house"

362
00:23:35,847 --> 00:23:37,781
turns into a couple of guys
at the lake house.

363
00:23:37,849 --> 00:23:39,316
My point exactly.

364
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:41,511
And I know I can at least get
"Shanna Suck-my-banana"

365
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,282
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
What's Julia's sweet shot?

366
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,951
- Key Lime Pie.
- Oh, come on, dude.

367
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,357
Even fucking Leroy Brown
would do one more for dessert.

368
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,693
Dude, check it out.

369
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,825
I wonder if B.J.
brought the bear with him.

370
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:00,531
Jesus.

371
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:06,606
Dude fucking cut himself
falling out of his time machine.

372
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:11,078
Hi, could I get a chicken suit
for Stroker Ace, please?

373
00:24:12,317 --> 00:24:15,445
<i># See the hole
I shot in his head #</i>

374
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,353
<i># The high sheriff

375
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:21,415
<i># Get your pistols

376
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,894

377
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,261

378

379
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,931
<i># If you want
that bad man Staggolee #</i>

380
00:24:37,008 --> 00:24:40,307
<i># You'll have to arrest him yourself</i>

381
00:24:40,378 --> 00:24:42,972
<i># The high sheriff
asked the bartender... #</i>

382
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,107
And where did you two disappear to?

383
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,445
I had to get something
out of the car,

384
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:49,749
and Nate was gentlemanly enough
to escort me with his umbrella.

385
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:51,686
Ah, good for you, Nate.

386
00:24:51,756 --> 00:24:54,190
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

387
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,622
Who, the dirty hippie?

388
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,528
Meow. She's not a hippie.

389
00:25:00,599 --> 00:25:01,725
She might as well be a hippie.

390
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,026
Thank you, Timmy boy.

391
00:25:06,137 --> 00:25:08,662
Well, do you know
what just happened to her?

392
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,504
No, but I know she's
a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.

393
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,640
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story?

394
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:17,704
What about her?

395
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,578
Hey, Warren!

396
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,781
Is there anybody you could
vouch for to give me a ride home?

397
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,886
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

398
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:31,861
You've been eavesdropping?

399
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,592
There's eavesdropping
and "can't help but hear."

400
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,691
I think I belong
in the latter category.

401
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:39,664
So, uh, Icy Hot.

402
00:25:39,738 --> 00:25:41,968
You're offering me a ride home?

403
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:45,669
I'm offering you a lift if when
I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

404
00:25:45,744 --> 00:25:47,974
And when are you
thinking about leaving?

405
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,911
Truthfully,
I'm not thinking about it.

406
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:53,983
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

407
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,418
Will you be able
to, uh, drive later?

408
00:25:56,488 --> 00:25:58,513
I know looks can be deceiving.

409
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,448
But I'm a teetotaler.

410
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:03,653
I've been drinking
club soda and lime all night,

411
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,719
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

412
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:10,097
- Which is what?
- Virgin piña colada.

413
00:26:10,936 --> 00:26:13,837
Okay. Why would
someone who doesn't drink

414
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:16,772
spend hours at a bar drinking water?

415
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:20,504
You know, a bar offers
all kind of things other than alcohol.

416
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,070
Mmm. Really?

417
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,513
Like what?

418
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:27,744
Women.

419
00:26:27,819 --> 00:26:30,287
Nacho grande platters.

420
00:26:30,355 --> 00:26:32,915
The fellowship
of some fascinating individuals,

421
00:26:32,991 --> 00:26:34,083
like Warren here.

422
00:26:35,393 --> 00:26:36,985
Alcohol is just a lubricant

423
00:26:37,062 --> 00:26:40,429
for all the individual
encounters that a barroom offers.

424
00:26:40,498 --> 00:26:42,966
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?

425
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:44,968
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.

426
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:47,631
I'm a stuntman.

427
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:52,075
But that's a very
easy mistake to make.

428
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,134
How do you know my name?

429
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:57,340
When you were talking with Warren...

430
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:58,746
couldn't help but overhear.

431
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,541
Fair enough.

432
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,247
So what's your name, Icy?

433
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:06,022
Stuntman Mike.

434
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,549
Stuntman Mike's your name?

435
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,425
Tsk. You ask anybody.

436
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:13,994
Hey, Warren.

437
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,430
Who is this guy?

438
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,331
Stuntman Mike.

439
00:27:17,402 --> 00:27:19,427
And who the hell
is Stuntman Mike?

440
00:27:19,504 --> 00:27:20,732
He's a stuntman.

441
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,638
Warren! Six shots of Wild Turkey!

442

You know, Pam,
I think it's time for my big drink.

452
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,400
Well, Stuntman Mike,
since I have a tab here,

453
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,601
can I buy you that
virgin piña colada?

454
00:27:58,677 --> 00:28:00,872
Thank you, Pam.
That'd be lovely.

455

A, uh, virgin piña colada

Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.

00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,768
<i># I've been refused #</i>

466
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,439
<i># A piece of bread... #</i>

467
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:14,080
- Ah!
- Hey, if it ain't Lanna-Frank.

468
00:29:14,152 --> 00:29:15,414
Mwah.

469
00:29:15,487 --> 00:29:16,818
- Hey, baby.
- How are you?

470
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:18,185
<i>- # In my life before #
- Hey, what's up?</i>

471
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:19,518
Hey!

472
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:22,219
Hey, what's shakin', bacon?

473
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,261
Hey.

474
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:27,162
<i># Go wrong as I do today #</i>

475
00:29:27,232 --> 00:29:30,201
<i>- # I want you to stop... #
- Well, let's scootch over, now.</i>

476
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,236
It's about fucking time.

477
00:29:32,303 --> 00:29:34,601
Well, beggars can't be choosers.

478
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,299
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.

479
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:39,736
What?

480
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:40,937
That table.

481
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,912
Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.

482
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,472
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

483
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:46,539
Yep.

484
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,781
She sure is a striking-looking woman.

485
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,788
It's got gin, tequila, Jäger...

486
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:52,845
Look at that hair.

487
00:29:52,924 --> 00:29:54,323
Lots of leave-in conditioner.

488
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,851
Is that jealousy I detect?

489
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,888
Hardly. But if you want
to get with, uh, Jungle Julia,

490
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,797
there's a real easy way to do that.

491
00:30:03,868 --> 00:30:05,426
Really, what would that be?

492
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,939
Get famous. You won't have
to find her... she'll find you.

493
00:30:09,007 --> 00:30:12,374
And you don't even want to know
what she did for that billboard.

494
00:30:12,443 --> 00:30:13,967
Enjoy it, cocksucker.

495
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:15,478
You've earned it.

496
00:30:15,547 --> 00:30:17,481
What did she ever do to you?

497
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,211
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

498
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:22,219
That's what she did to me.

499
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,881
She was her height right now at 12.

500
00:30:24,956 --> 00:30:26,787
She was a monster.

501
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,760
Half the guys she still fucks
she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.

502
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:33,627
And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

503
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,222
That pituitary case?

504
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,995
Might have kicked my ass
a couple of times...

505
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:39,901
sorry, I'm built like a girl,
not a black man...

506
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,634
but I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

507
00:31:15,273 --> 00:31:19,004
Hey! Are you
famous or somethin'?

508
00:31:19,077 --> 00:31:20,442
Or somethin'.

509
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:21,876
No, no, no. Really.

510
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:24,878
Hey, what do... what do you do?

511
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,080
Really?

512
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:31,053
What I do is work my ass off to get
my own record label off the ground,

513
00:31:31,122 --> 00:31:35,616
but why that girl wanted a picture of me
is because I'm a local D.J.

514
00:31:38,096 --> 00:31:39,529
Wait a minute.

515
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,359
You've got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?

516
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:45,902
Yeah.

517
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,370
I got one there, too, Zatoichi.

518
00:31:51,209 --> 00:31:52,437
Yeah.

519
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:55,737
Jungle Julia Lucai.

520
00:31:55,813 --> 00:31:57,747
Stuntman Mike McKay.

521
00:31:57,815 --> 00:31:59,180
Well.

522
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:02,344
Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.

523
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,752
My friends and I are going
to continue to get our weed on.

524
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,084
Would you care for some?

525
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:07,590
Thank you, Julia,

526
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,526
but just the same...
no thanks.

527
00:32:10,595 --> 00:32:12,119
- Suit yourself.
- But you know...

528
00:32:22,206 --> 00:32:24,140
Oh, shit.

529
00:32:24,208 --> 00:32:25,368
Ah! My God.

530
00:32:28,179 --> 00:32:29,339
Sorry. It's nothing.

531
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:34,316
What the fuck was that?

532
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:40,755
You got some voucher here.

533
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:42,486
I asked him
what movies you worked on.

534
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,255
No fuckin' clue.

535
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,560
Well, technically I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

536
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,601
I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparral,

537
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,067
a guy falls off a horse,

538
00:32:52,136 --> 00:32:53,228
he says it's him.

539
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,236
You know the show The Virginian?

540
00:32:58,943 --> 00:33:01,639
Yeah, well, there was another
actor on that show, Gary Clarke,

541
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:03,578
and I looked like him a bit...

542
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:06,811
well, obviously
before I cut myself shaving.

543
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,852
Tsk. Aww, I like it.

544
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:13,152
Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet
you make sugar taste just like salt.

545
00:33:13,224 --> 00:33:16,660
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.

546
00:33:16,728 --> 00:33:20,459
And, uh... then that show turned
into The Men of Shiloh,

547
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:23,261
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

548
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,599
From that point on
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

549
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:30,232
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vega$.

550
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:32,538
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

551
00:33:32,610 --> 00:33:35,477
And then Bob
did another show, Gavilan.

552
00:33:35,546 --> 00:33:38,037
and he brought me
with him on that, till...

553
00:33:39,817 --> 00:33:41,079
And after that...

554
00:33:45,256 --> 00:33:48,623
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talkin' about?

555
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,058
Sorry.

556
00:33:50,128 --> 00:33:51,117
- No?
- Mm-mm.

557
00:33:51,195 --> 00:33:52,856
No, no.

558
00:33:55,433 --> 00:34:00,666
So how exactly does one
become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?

559
00:34:02,907 --> 00:34:07,071
Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

560
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:09,875
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

561
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:13,576
But really I got into the business the way
most people get into the stunt business.

562
00:34:13,651 --> 00:34:14,913
How's that?

563
00:34:14,986 --> 00:34:17,477
- My brother got me in it.
- Well, who's your brother?

564
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,920
Stuntman Bob.

565
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:33,664
I'm ready to blaze!

566
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,605
Finally, yeah.
You need to catch up with us.

567
00:34:36,674 --> 00:34:38,938
- Now the party can start.
- Yep.

568
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:42,343
Anywho, I'm sorry.
You forgive me?

569
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:48,081
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

570
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,313
Promise.
You ready to go to the lake?

571
00:34:50,388 --> 00:34:51,377
Mm-hmm.

572
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:54,220
- How about your friend, bring him?
- I thought no boys.

573
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,522
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

574
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,188
So how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

575
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:00,958
Mmm, us girls.

576
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:02,329
Good idea.

577
00:35:04,235 --> 00:35:05,327
Ladies?

578
00:35:07,705 --> 00:35:08,694
Thanks.

579
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:11,603
Cheers, Butterfly.

580
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:18,311
"The woods are lovely,
dark, and deep...

581
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,145
"And I have promises to keep,

582
00:35:20,218 --> 00:35:23,619
And miles to go
before I sleep."

583
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:25,656
Did you hear me, Butterfly?

584
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:30,659
"Miles to go
before you sleep."

585
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:34,053
Sorry, Stuntman Burt...

586
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,292
Mike.

587
00:35:35,466 --> 00:35:36,763
Mike.

588
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:38,825
She already broke off that dance.

589
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,393
Is that true?

590
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,667
Did I miss my chance?

591
00:35:47,411 --> 00:35:49,436
Do I frighten you?

592
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,750
Is it my scar?

593
00:35:57,922 --> 00:35:59,651
It's your car.

594
00:35:59,724 --> 00:36:01,783
Ah, yeah, I know.

595
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,020
Sorry.

596
00:36:04,095 --> 00:36:05,926
It's my mom's car.

597
00:36:08,366 --> 00:36:10,061
Have you been following us?

598
00:36:10,134 --> 00:36:12,830
No, but that's
what I love about Austin...

599
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,168
it's just so damn small.

600
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,867
- You've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

601
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:20,342
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

602
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:24,240
You saw my car,
I saw your legs.

603
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,648
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

604
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:29,686
So you really weren't following us?

605
00:36:29,754 --> 00:36:33,588
I'm not following you, Butterfly.
I just... got lucky.

606
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:40,160
So, how about that lap dance?

607
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:41,960
Sorry, it was a one-time only offer,

608
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,399
and she did it
earlier this evening at Antone's.

609
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,895
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

610
00:36:47,972 --> 00:36:49,997
I'm good that way.

611
00:36:50,074 --> 00:36:53,874
- Tsk. And you look a little touchéd.
- What's "touchéd"?

612
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:55,139
Wounded, slightly.

613
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,475
Why should I be wounded?

614
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:59,516
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

615
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,348
but from your look I can tell
nobody pestered you at all.

616
00:37:03,588 --> 00:37:06,022
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

617
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:12,995
There are few things as fetching
as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.

618
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:17,756
So...

619
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:22,870
How about that lap dance?

620
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:26,703
I think I'm going
to have to give you a rain check.

621
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,810
Well, since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,

622
00:37:31,882 --> 00:37:33,873
that rain check'll be worthless.

623
00:37:36,153 --> 00:37:37,177
But that's okay.

624
00:37:39,056 --> 00:37:41,320
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

625
00:37:42,159 --> 00:37:43,990
You're still a nice girl.

626
00:37:44,061 --> 00:37:45,858
And I still like you.

627
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:49,426
But I must warn you of something.

628
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,126
You know how people say,

629
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:54,899
"You're okay in my book,"

630
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:58,237
or, "In my book, that's no good."

631
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:03,975
Well, I actually have a book.

632
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:07,950
And everybody
I ever meet goes in this book.

633
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:12,422
And now I've met you,
and you're goin' in the book.

634
00:38:13,891 --> 00:38:15,688
Except...

635
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,890
I'm afraid I must file you...

636
00:38:19,964 --> 00:38:21,898
under...

637
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,490
"Chicken Shit."

638
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,865
And what if I did it?

639
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:28,200
Well, I definitely couldn't
file you under "Chicken Shit,"

640
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,365
then, now, could I?

641
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,738
What's your name again?

642
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,045
- Stuntman Mike.
- Well, Stuntman Mike...

643
00:38:36,113 --> 00:38:37,671
I'm Butterfly.

644
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:42,276
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

645
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:44,082
Yeah, it is.

646
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:45,144
Yeah.

647
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:48,454
Well, why don't you go
get ready for your lap dance?

648
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:05,566
What about "kind of cute,
kind of hot, kind of sexy,

649
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:07,474
"hysterically funny
but not funny-looking guy

650
00:39:07,545 --> 00:39:10,378
who you could fuck"
did you not understand?

651
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,460
<i># Aah, aah #</i>

I'm driving.

701
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,148
We're gonna go somewhere else,
gonna go hang out.

702
00:42:06,223 --> 00:42:07,212
Ready to go?

703
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,485
Yeah.

704
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:10,322
- Bye.
Bye.

705
00:42:13,597 --> 00:42:15,827
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

706
00:42:17,434 --> 00:42:19,595
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!

707
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,672
He's just giving me a ride.

708
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:23,764
Oh, no doubt.

709
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:26,139
Have a nice ride!

710
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:29,410
Look, double fucks.

711
00:42:33,751 --> 00:42:35,719
I am not gonna fuck him.

712
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:37,219
I can hear you.

713
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:42,148
- He's old enough to be my dad.
- I can still hear you.

714
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,556
Bye.

715
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,688
Bye-bye!

716
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,039
Wow, that's fucking scary.

717
00:42:56,106 --> 00:42:58,131
Yeah, well, I wanted it
to be impressive and...

718
00:42:58,208 --> 00:43:00,233
scary tends to impress.

719
00:43:01,679 --> 00:43:02,839
Is it safe?

720
00:43:02,913 --> 00:43:04,881
No, it's better than safe.

721
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:06,576
It's death-proof.

722
00:43:06,650 --> 00:43:09,175
How do you make a car death-proof?

723
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,050
Well, that's what stuntmen do.

724
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:13,749
You've seen a movie where
a car gets into some smash-up

725
00:43:13,824 --> 00:43:16,258
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?

726
00:43:16,327 --> 00:43:17,316
Yeah.

727
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,885
Well, how do you
think they accomplish that?

728
00:43:19,964 --> 00:43:21,989
CGI?

729
00:43:22,066 --> 00:43:26,002
Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays
more often than not, you're right.

730
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:28,334
Tsk. But back
in the all-or-nothin' days...

731
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:32,205
Vanishing Point days,
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,

732
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:33,937
the White Line Fever days...

733
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,980
real cars smashing into real cars.

734
00:43:37,047 --> 00:43:39,675
Real dumb people driving 'em.

735
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:42,776
So, give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

736
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,413
they take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere and...

737
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,478
Voila!

738
00:43:46,557 --> 00:43:49,993
You got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

739
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:55,123
That makes sense. I just didn't know
you could make a car death-proof.

740
00:43:55,199 --> 00:43:58,999
Well, I can drive this baby into
a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.

741
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,270
Just for the experience.

742
00:44:08,012 --> 00:44:10,242
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

743
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,838
Well, this is a movie car.

744
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:15,442
Sometimes when you're shootin' a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car...

745
00:44:15,519 --> 00:44:17,680
you know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

746
00:44:17,755 --> 00:44:20,690
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a "crash box."

747
00:44:23,427 --> 00:44:25,088
There you go.

748
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,460
You know, when you
asked to drive me home,

749
00:44:27,531 --> 00:44:29,431
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

750
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,492
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

751
00:44:32,569 --> 00:44:34,469
You asked me for a ride,
and I said, "Yes."

752
00:44:34,538 --> 00:44:35,869
But look at the bright side, Pam...

753
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:38,908
I won't be gettin' fresh,
putting my hand on your knee.

754
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:42,508
That is a bright side.

755
00:44:43,547 --> 00:44:44,707
I thought so.

756
00:45:10,741 --> 00:45:12,140
Well, Pam...

757
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:13,471
which way are you going?

758
00:45:13,544 --> 00:45:15,375
- Left or right?
- Right.

759
00:45:15,446 --> 00:45:17,414
Ah, that's too bad.

760
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:19,106
Why?

761
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,051
Well, because it was a 50/50 shot
on whether you 'd be going left or right.

762
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,247
You see, we're both going left.

763
00:45:25,322 --> 00:45:27,313
You could have just
as easily been going left, too,

764
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,688
and if that was the case,

765
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:31,421
it would have been a while
before you started getting scared.

766
00:45:31,495 --> 00:45:33,861
But since
you're going the other way,

767
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,489
I'm afraid...

768
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,967
you're gonna
have to start getting scared...

769
00:45:39,036 --> 00:45:40,094
immediately.

770
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:41,262
What the fuck?!

771
00:45:50,781 --> 00:45:52,612
Cocksucking motherfucker!

772
00:45:52,683 --> 00:45:54,275
Just fucking let me out of here!

773
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:55,909
I'll fucking rip your fucking...

774
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:57,385
Stop the fucking car!

775
00:45:57,454 --> 00:45:59,285
Why are you being such a shit?

776
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,360
Okay.

777
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,830
Here's the thing.

778
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,993
I get it.

779
00:46:45,068 --> 00:46:47,764
I... I know it's a joke,
and super funny.

780
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:52,338
Um, but if you just stop right now,

781
00:46:52,409 --> 00:46:54,809
you know, and... and let me out,

782
00:46:54,878 --> 00:46:58,245
I'll never tell anybody
because I know it's a joke.

783
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,646
I know all about jokes.

784
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:01,149
Ha ha ha!

785
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:04,654
I promise everything'll be fine.

786
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:07,212
Just... just... just let me out.

787
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:08,280
Please?

788
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,121
- And... and... and...
- Hey, Pam!

789
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:14,687
Remember when I said
this car was death proof?

790
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,030
Well, that wasn't a lie.

791
00:47:18,101 --> 00:47:20,695
This car is 100% death proof.

792
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,574
Only to get the benefit of it, honey...

793
00:47:24,641 --> 00:47:27,633
you really need to be sittin' in my seat.

794
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:08,677
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

795
00:48:23,166 --> 00:48:24,155
No, no, no, no, no, no.

796
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:27,465
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick and Tich.

797
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:29,930
So, you got it?

798
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,874
Thanks, honey.
You're gonna play it next song, right?

799
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:35,976
Good boy.

800
00:48:37,447 --> 00:48:39,108
Growl!

801
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:41,241
Bye-bye.

802
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:42,751
Who do you want to hear?

803
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,719
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

804
00:48:44,788 --> 00:48:46,050
Who?

805
00:48:46,123 --> 00:48:49,752
Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, and Tich.

806
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,225
Who the fuck are they?

807
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,093
For your information,
Pete Townshend, at one point,

808
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:55,927
almost quit The Who,
and if he had,

809
00:48:55,999 --> 00:48:57,660
he would have ended up in this group,

810
00:48:57,734 --> 00:49:01,465
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.

811
00:49:01,538 --> 00:49:03,096
And if you ask me,
he should have.

812
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,573
That's my boy!

813
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,590
<i># Hold tight, count to three #</i>

814
00:49:21,658 --> 00:49:23,717
<i># Gotta stay close by me #</i>

815
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,557

816
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:27,494

817
00:49:27,564 --> 00:49:29,555

818
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:34,730
<i># Girl, you suit me for size... #</i>

819
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:38,571
<i># Forget the other guys #</i>

820
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,078

821

822
00:49:46,083 --> 00:49:51,851

829

830
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,652
I want to hear
this part of the song louder!

831
00:51:45,068 --> 00:51:46,729
Do you remember anything?

832
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,970
Uh... I... I don't remember.

833
00:51:54,544 --> 00:51:55,977
Doctor Block.

834
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:05,447
Self-restraints to Room 310.

835
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,922
Self-restraints to Room 310.

836
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:14,428
Well. What's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?

837
00:52:14,498 --> 00:52:16,728
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

838
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,631
Come on now, Sis.

839
00:52:18,702 --> 00:52:21,000
You just tell us.

840
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:22,402
How bad is he?

841
00:52:27,077 --> 00:52:28,806
He got banged up real good.

842
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:33,282
Busted nose, broken collarbone,
smashed up his left index finger.

843
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:34,544
Is that it?

844
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:38,082
He was real lucky.

845
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:42,053
That'll be all?

846
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:45,424
Well, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

847
00:52:49,266 --> 00:52:50,756
Son of a bitch.

848
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:53,894
So, Pop.

849
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:55,494
What do you think?

850
00:52:55,572 --> 00:52:57,403
Well, Son Number One,

851
00:52:57,474 --> 00:53:01,638
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

852
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:04,943
Well, give it a shot.

853
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:08,041
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

854
00:53:08,118 --> 00:53:10,848
That ol' boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

855
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:14,687
I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet,
but they're dead just the same.

856
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:19,285
Well, what are you gonna do?

857
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:21,057
Not a goddamn thing.

858
00:53:21,131 --> 00:53:23,395
D.A. says there ain't no crime here.

859
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:29,238
Every one of them gals was swimming
in alcohol and floatin' on weed,

860
00:53:29,306 --> 00:53:33,174
and old Hooper in there
came out clean as a whistle.

861
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:37,646
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatively murdered them gals?

862
00:53:37,714 --> 00:53:39,477
Well, I can't prove it.

863
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,712
But since thinkin' don't cost nothin',
I can think it, and I do.

864
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:46,153
Yeah, but Pop, he got
pretty banged up himself.

865
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:48,748
Well, hell yeah,
he got banged up, but goddamn...

866
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:51,555
I mean, them pretty little gals in there
look like a goddamn giant

867
00:53:51,628 --> 00:53:53,323
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.

868
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:54,761
Did any of 'em survive?

869
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,731
Shit.

870
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,268
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

871
00:53:59,336 --> 00:54:01,736
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton...

872
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,898
they all princess died.

873
00:54:11,014 --> 00:54:12,413
Why?

874
00:54:12,482 --> 00:54:16,782
Well, I'd guesstimate
it's a sex thing.

875
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,844
The only way I can figure it.

876
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:24,053
High-velocity impact,
twisted metal, busted glass,

877
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,187
all four souls taken
exactly the same time.

878
00:54:28,531 --> 00:54:32,524
Probably the only way that diabolical
degenerate can shoot his goo.

879
00:54:33,703 --> 00:54:36,228
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on

880
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:39,798
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.

881
00:54:39,876 --> 00:54:42,743
That was just plain old,
goddamn reckless endangerment.

882
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,804
But I got me a goddamn bartender

883
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:49,511
gonna testify that ol' Stuntman
Mike didn't drink a drop all night.

884
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,153
And his passenger
was left stranded by her date,

885
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:56,954
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.

886
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,861
Now, on paper, this is gonna look
like he was just trying to help her out.

887
00:55:00,930 --> 00:55:03,228
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.

888
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,495
So, what are you gonna do, Pop?

889
00:55:05,568 --> 00:55:06,660
Tsk.

890
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,671
Well, I could take it
upon myself to work the case,

891
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:15,313
Search for evidence,
you know, prove my theory.

892
00:55:15,386 --> 00:55:16,648
Alert authorities.

893
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:20,316
Dog that rotten son of a bitch...
wherever he goes, I go.

894
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:25,522
Or I could spend the same
goddamn amount of time and energy

895
00:55:25,597 --> 00:55:28,532
following the NASCAR circuit.

896
00:55:28,600 --> 00:55:30,760
Hmm. I've thought about it a lot.

897
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:34,292
I think I'd have a hell
of a lot happier life if I did the latter.

898
00:55:34,371 --> 00:55:35,360
And just because I can't

899
00:55:35,439 --> 00:55:39,671
punish Old Frankenstein
in there for what he's done,

900
00:55:39,743 --> 00:55:42,541
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John...

901
00:55:42,613 --> 00:55:44,604
if he ever does it again,

902
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:47,980
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.

903
00:55:59,262 --> 00:56:01,457

921
00:57:13,967 --> 00:57:17,130
Are you on the same floor as him?
No, he's on the fourth.

922
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:19,536
- And who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.

923
00:57:19,606 --> 00:57:20,868
And so what happened then?

924
00:57:20,941 --> 00:57:25,207
We made out for about ten minutes,
and then I sent him off to his room.

925
00:57:25,279 --> 00:57:28,874
- So how's the Rock as a kisser?
- Mm, he's damn good.

926
00:57:28,949 --> 00:57:31,747
He's got them mushy lips,
smooth fingertips.

927
00:57:31,819 --> 00:57:33,719
Mm, I love them mushy lips.

928
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,915
He's a big guy, so he spins me around
so my back is up against him,

929
00:57:36,990 --> 00:57:39,550
takes his big hand
and puts it on my throat,

930
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:44,086
tilts my head back and leans over me,
kisses me from behind.

931
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:45,562
Damn, that sounds sexy!

932
00:57:45,631 --> 00:57:47,155
It was sexy.

933
00:57:47,233 --> 00:57:51,135
But then that was it?
You sent him off? How'd he take it?

934
00:57:51,204 --> 00:57:52,899
Wait a minute, what are we doing here?

935
00:57:52,972 --> 00:57:56,703
If I'm gonna power through and pick up
Zoë at the airport, I need coffee.

936
00:57:56,776 --> 00:58:00,610
Since you're getting that, can you get
some more vodka and sugar-free Red Bull?

937
00:58:02,982 --> 00:58:04,279
We didn't know you were awake.

938
00:58:04,350 --> 00:58:06,045
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.

939
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:09,213
But get some more vodka
and some sugar-free Red Bull anyway.

940
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:11,456
And some Red Apple Tans.

941
00:58:11,524 --> 00:58:13,992
Damn, I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries.

942
00:58:16,229 --> 00:58:18,662
- You remember how to get to the airport?
Uh-huh.

943
00:58:18,730 --> 00:58:21,563
Then you should get behind the wheel,
'cause you gonna drive.

944
00:58:23,435 --> 00:58:24,925
Motherfuckers.

945
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,654
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.

946
00:58:43,722 --> 00:58:46,316
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.

947
00:58:46,391 --> 00:58:49,121
G.O.
G.O.!

948
00:59:14,385 --> 00:59:20,517
# It's not the way you kiss
that says you're mine #

949
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:28,353
# Many, many, many nights go by #

950
00:59:28,431 --> 00:59:34,199
# I sit alone at home and cry over you #

951
00:59:34,270 --> 00:59:37,467
# What can I do #

952
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:43,001
# Don't want nobody, nobody #

953
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,378
# 'Cause, baby, it's you #

954
00:59:55,859 --> 00:59:59,420
# Is it true what they say #

955
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:03,658
# All about you #

956
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:11,095
# They say you'll never
ever never be true #

957
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:18,373
# It doesn't matter what they say #

958
01:00:18,447 --> 01:00:22,008
# I know I'm gonna
love you any old way #

959
01:00:22,084 --> 01:00:25,053
# What would I do #

960
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:28,317
# Without you #

961
01:00:28,390 --> 01:00:30,722
# I don't want nobody... #

962
01:00:30,993 --> 01:00:33,825
Where the hell are my keys?
Here they are.

963
01:00:35,196 --> 01:00:37,824
Sorry, I didn't mean to give
you a concert there.

964
01:00:37,899 --> 01:00:40,026
No, it wasn't you.

965
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:42,797
That guy bumped into my feet
when he walked by.

966
01:00:44,238 --> 01:00:47,071
I don't know why,
but that kind of creeped me out.

967
01:01:02,957 --> 01:01:06,017
<i># I don't care
what they saying to me #</i>

968
01:01:12,666 --> 01:01:14,190
Little dick.

969
01:01:16,036 --> 01:01:17,367
Clearly.

970
01:01:18,972 --> 01:01:24,000
Since I'm up,
I might as well hit the ATM.

971
01:01:25,345 --> 01:01:27,404
Get me a fuckin' smoke.

972
01:02:51,595 --> 01:02:53,358
What?

973
01:02:53,430 --> 01:02:55,398
Did you just see the...

974
01:02:55,465 --> 01:02:56,454
What?

975
01:02:58,735 --> 01:02:59,861
Nothing, honey.

976
01:03:23,492 --> 01:03:24,481
Y'ello.

977
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,891
It's me.

978
01:03:25,961 --> 01:03:27,258
Miss me?

979
01:03:28,764 --> 01:03:31,358
You best get your ass
off Kim's car.

980
01:03:31,434 --> 01:03:35,200
- I've seen Kim sit on it before.
- Her ass ain't your ass.

981
01:03:35,271 --> 01:03:39,708
Okay. So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.

982
01:03:43,279 --> 01:03:44,769
You got Allure?

983
01:03:44,847 --> 01:03:46,747
Magazines by the window.

984
01:04:01,129 --> 01:04:02,790
Here you are!

985
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:07,495
You hot mama, you.

986
01:04:07,569 --> 01:04:09,400
See you in a second.

987
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,565
$3.85... out of 20.

988
01:04:16,678 --> 01:04:19,670
And you get 16 and change back.
Thank you very much.

989
01:04:22,050 --> 01:04:25,281
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.

990
01:04:27,822 --> 01:04:30,256
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.

991
01:04:30,325 --> 01:04:31,484
Thought I'd ask.

992
01:04:31,558 --> 01:04:33,321
- Thanks anyway.
- Have a good one.

993
01:04:36,463 --> 01:04:39,125
I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.

994
01:04:44,371 --> 01:04:45,633
This month's?

995
01:04:47,474 --> 01:04:49,738
Listen to this.

996
01:04:49,810 --> 01:04:54,543
The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.

997
01:04:54,615 --> 01:04:55,775
- No way.
- Way!

998
01:04:55,849 --> 01:04:58,340
I can't believe fuckin' Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.

999
01:04:58,418 --> 01:05:00,852
It doesn't. It's his own personal copy.

1000
01:05:00,921 --> 01:05:03,185
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.

1001
01:05:03,257 --> 01:05:05,121
27 bucks?

1002
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:07,625
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about per diem here.

1003
01:05:07,693 --> 01:05:10,594
We found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.

1004
01:05:10,663 --> 01:05:12,597
We're lucky he's not asking
for fuckin' Krugerrands.

1005
01:05:12,665 --> 01:05:14,792
I'm getting it, and we're
splitting it three ways.

1006
01:05:14,867 --> 01:05:16,129
What, me, you, and Kim?

1007
01:05:16,202 --> 01:05:18,033
Kim doesn't give
a shit about Italian Vogue.

1008
01:05:18,104 --> 01:05:21,767
but Brandy'll come in with us,
and if she won't, Tisla, her sister, will.

1009
01:05:22,608 --> 01:05:25,577
Okay, but if anybody tears out
any sheets I want,

1010
01:05:25,645 --> 01:05:29,012
you gotta make color Xeroxes
of those pages, and I'm not talking Kinko's.

1011
01:05:29,081 --> 01:05:33,108
You take it to the art department
and have them do it fuckin' right.

1012
01:05:50,835 --> 01:05:53,133
Whoo!

1013
01:05:56,775 --> 01:05:58,003
Oh, my God!

1014
01:06:06,151 --> 01:06:07,550
Got it!

1015
01:06:17,161 --> 01:06:19,186
...the actress...

1016
01:06:30,674 --> 01:06:32,164
Oh, boy.

1017
01:06:35,145 --> 01:06:37,170
Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë.

1018
01:06:37,248 --> 01:06:41,844
It just so happens we're all three
off-duty for the next three days.

1019
01:06:41,919 --> 01:06:44,387
Fuckin' hell! How does that happen?

1020
01:06:44,455 --> 01:06:47,446
I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days.

1021
01:06:47,523 --> 01:06:50,390
There's no stunts being filmed
during that time so Kim's free,

1022
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:54,556
and Lee's on a will-notify
for the four days.

1023
01:06:54,631 --> 01:06:56,189
So how's the shoot going?

1024
01:06:56,266 --> 01:06:58,325
Great. We're having the best time.

1025
01:06:58,401 --> 01:07:00,494
The director, Cecil Evans, is so fun.

1026
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:03,801
We're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

1027
01:07:03,873 --> 01:07:07,468
Hell, yeah. The next job
after this one is definitely gonna suck.

1028
01:07:07,543 --> 01:07:09,443
So let's hear it, ladies.

1029
01:07:09,512 --> 01:07:11,912
Set romances! Who's getting it off?

1030
01:07:11,981 --> 01:07:14,609
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

1031
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:17,710
Oh, Toolbox!
Name sounds promising.

1032
01:07:17,787 --> 01:07:19,913
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

1033
01:07:19,988 --> 01:07:22,286
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

1034
01:07:23,558 --> 01:07:24,547
What's his perversion?

1035
01:07:26,662 --> 01:07:29,096
He likes to watch me pee.

1036
01:07:29,665 --> 01:07:34,125
# Lee is sitting on a toilet
and Toolbox is watching her pee #

1037
01:07:34,202 --> 01:07:36,261
# P-I-S-S-I-N-G #

1038
01:07:36,338 --> 01:07:37,327
Ooh!

1039
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:39,368
Yeah, but not no more.

1040
01:07:39,441 --> 01:07:41,671
Now she's getting it on
with the Rock.

1041
01:07:41,743 --> 01:07:43,608
You had a one-off with the Rock?

1042
01:07:43,679 --> 01:07:46,113
Well, not the real Rock.
He's this electrician named Bruce.

1043
01:07:46,181 --> 01:07:50,015
He looks like the Rock,
so we all just call him the Rock.

1044
01:07:50,085 --> 01:07:51,746
Oh, yeah, this is an all-star crew.

1045
01:07:51,820 --> 01:07:55,414
We got a guy who looks like Nic Cage
and Pee Wee Herman, too.

1046
01:07:55,489 --> 01:07:57,923
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it!

1047
01:07:57,992 --> 01:08:01,359
Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
I got a man.

1048
01:08:01,429 --> 01:08:04,660
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

1049
01:08:04,732 --> 01:08:06,359
Who'd you steal him from?

1050
01:08:06,434 --> 01:08:07,731
Nobody!

1051
01:08:07,802 --> 01:08:10,362
Kim!
- Wha... what?

1052
01:08:10,438 --> 01:08:12,099
He totally had a girlfriend.

1053
01:08:12,173 --> 01:08:15,802
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

1054
01:08:15,876 --> 01:08:17,969
I did not steal him!

1055
01:08:18,045 --> 01:08:23,176
I didn't steal any of them;
they just... jumped ship.

1056
01:08:25,419 --> 01:08:29,184
- So what's your story, Abernathy?
- Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.

1057
01:08:29,255 --> 01:08:31,985
I had a set crush on Cecil.

1058
01:08:32,058 --> 01:08:35,391
Set crush? Nigga, please.
You were his set wife!

1059
01:08:35,462 --> 01:08:37,692
"Were" and "had" being
the key words, here.

1060
01:08:37,764 --> 01:08:40,460
Bitch, you two are still
into each other and you know it.

1061
01:08:40,533 --> 01:08:45,596
Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me,
why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?

1062
01:08:49,175 --> 01:08:52,838
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

1063
01:08:52,912 --> 01:08:54,379
Oh, it's so funny!

1064
01:08:54,447 --> 01:08:56,972
Stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

1065
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:58,847
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

1066
01:08:58,918 --> 01:09:01,886
You need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

1067
01:09:01,954 --> 01:09:04,889
Oh, well, now you put it like that...

1068
01:09:05,758 --> 01:09:08,158
Oh, I haven't told you the best part.

1069
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:11,321
He fucked her on my birthday.

1070
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:14,230
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

1071
01:09:14,299 --> 01:09:17,166
- Thank you.
- Did he know it was your birthday?

1072
01:09:17,236 --> 01:09:19,966
I mean, he's the director.
He's kind of busy.

1073
01:09:20,038 --> 01:09:24,475
He ate a piece of my birthday cake,
and he got me a present.

1074
01:09:24,543 --> 01:09:26,534
- Wow.
- Yeah... I think he knew.

1075
01:09:28,213 --> 01:09:29,703
What did he get you?

1076
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:34,752
He made me a tape.

1077
01:09:34,920 --> 01:09:36,546
He made you a tape?

1078
01:09:36,621 --> 01:09:38,851
Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?

1079
01:09:38,923 --> 01:09:40,288
He made you a tape?

1080
01:09:40,358 --> 01:09:43,350
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic!

1081
01:09:43,428 --> 01:09:46,522
Yes, I know what you're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

1082
01:09:46,597 --> 01:09:48,622
This sounds like the test
of true love to me.

1083
01:09:48,699 --> 01:09:52,396
Look, I know you guys like him.
He's likeable.

1084
01:09:52,470 --> 01:09:55,064
But he fucked another woman
on my birthday.

1085
01:09:55,139 --> 01:09:57,505
How can you not be on my side?

1086
01:09:57,575 --> 01:09:59,065
I admit, that sounds bad.

1087
01:09:59,143 --> 01:10:00,405
It is bad!

1088
01:10:00,478 --> 01:10:03,345
It just sounds like there's
a little more to it than that.

1089
01:10:03,414 --> 01:10:04,574
Were you two fucking?

1090
01:10:04,649 --> 01:10:06,139
Hell, no.

1091
01:10:06,217 --> 01:10:08,082
Hello, is your name Abernathy?

1092
01:10:08,152 --> 01:10:09,140
Sorry.

1093
01:10:09,219 --> 01:10:12,780
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

1094
01:10:12,856 --> 01:10:15,848
What do you mean "No, of course not"?

1095
01:10:15,926 --> 01:10:18,918
The reason Cecil hasn't had
a girlfriend in six years

1096
01:10:18,995 --> 01:10:22,294
is because girls will fuck him,
and if you fuck Cecil,

1097
01:10:22,365 --> 01:10:24,629
you don't become one
of his girlfriends...

1098
01:10:24,701 --> 01:10:27,636
not to say I want to be his girlfriend,

1099
01:10:27,704 --> 01:10:32,903
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,
if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.

1100
01:10:32,976 --> 01:10:38,642
I'd be one of his regulars,
and I'm getting too fuckin' old for that shit.

1101
01:10:38,715 --> 01:10:41,912
- Have you let him do anything?
- Yes!

1102
01:10:43,619 --> 01:10:45,519
I've let him give me a foot massage,

1103
01:10:45,588 --> 01:10:49,456
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.

1104
01:10:49,525 --> 01:10:52,255
Bitch, you might be actin'
like you 12 years old,

1105
01:10:52,328 --> 01:10:53,852
but he just acting like a man.

1106
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:56,022
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

1107
01:10:56,098 --> 01:10:57,429
Let me get this straight...

1108
01:10:58,467 --> 01:11:01,766
you're not fucking him,
you're not sucking him,

1109
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:05,705
you're not giving him any tongue,
but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?

1110
01:11:05,774 --> 01:11:07,935
Can we just take my sex life
off the table?

1111
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:11,377
Actually, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table...

1112
01:11:11,447 --> 01:11:13,108
and your lack of one.

1113
01:11:18,920 --> 01:11:21,286
Fuck both of you
and your little high-five.

1114
01:11:21,356 --> 01:11:25,793
Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,

1115
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:28,761
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job

1116
01:11:28,830 --> 01:11:30,559
in the back of the van
on Tuesday.

1117
01:11:30,632 --> 01:11:31,792
I'm not gonna do that!

1118
01:11:31,866 --> 01:11:34,426
I know you won't!
But you know who will...

1119
01:11:34,502 --> 01:11:37,471
the bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.

1120
01:11:37,539 --> 01:11:40,599
I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim's said,

1121
01:11:40,675 --> 01:11:44,475
but it is true if you've stretched it out
like you have with Cecil

1122
01:11:44,546 --> 01:11:49,108
and you suddenly get dirty on them,
it blows their mind.

1123
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,886
So Zoë, Kim, and I are
in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.

1124
01:11:53,954 --> 01:11:57,287
What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head. Part Three.

1125
01:11:57,357 --> 01:12:00,793
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked up.

1126
01:12:00,861 --> 01:12:03,125
Cheers to that.
- Word.

1127
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:05,058
Cheers.

1128
01:12:05,132 --> 01:12:06,656
So Zoë...

1129
01:12:07,801 --> 01:12:11,669
the genius, wants to take
a picture of me.

1130
01:12:12,806 --> 01:12:16,207
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

1131
01:12:16,276 --> 01:12:19,905
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying, "Step back a little!"

1132
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:21,038
So I do.

1133
01:12:21,114 --> 01:12:23,446
Then "A little fu-ther!"

1134
01:12:23,517 --> 01:12:28,180
So I step back a little fu-ther.
Then "A little more!" So I do.

1135
01:12:28,254 --> 01:12:34,193
Then I realize I'm at the edge
of a seven-foot concrete ditch...

1136
01:12:34,260 --> 01:12:36,694
...with God knows how many rocks

1137
01:12:36,762 --> 01:12:40,994
and broken bottles and rats in it,
and if I fell in that fucking thing,

1138
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:43,058
I probably would have broken my neck.

1139
01:12:43,135 --> 01:12:46,866
So I am yelling at her:
"Zoë, you almost killed me!"

1140
01:12:48,541 --> 01:12:52,568
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

1141
01:12:52,645 --> 01:12:55,170
and Zoë starts fuckin' around.

1142
01:12:55,247 --> 01:12:59,342
And... bam! ...if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch!

1143
01:13:00,819 --> 01:13:02,582
Nice.

1144
01:13:02,654 --> 01:13:05,316
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

1145
01:13:06,424 --> 01:13:08,892
I remember taking a step
and looking down,

1146
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,521
just as I'm thinking, "There's that ditch
Abbie was talking about."

1147
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,963
Bam! I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.

1148
01:13:15,033 --> 01:13:16,398
What happened?

1149
01:13:16,468 --> 01:13:18,834
What, with Zoë, the cat?

1150
01:13:18,903 --> 01:13:19,927
Nothing.

1151
01:13:20,005 --> 01:13:23,998
If I fell in that fuckin' thing, they would
have had to helicopter me out of there.

1152
01:13:24,075 --> 01:13:26,373
Zoë just lands on her feet.

1153
01:13:26,444 --> 01:13:30,574
But then later I started feeling
a little bad about myself...

1154
01:13:30,649 --> 01:13:35,711
Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
We're laughing about it.

1155
01:13:35,786 --> 01:13:40,120
If I fell in that fucking thing,
I probably would have been paralyzed.

1156
01:13:40,190 --> 01:13:42,454
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

1157
01:13:42,526 --> 01:13:46,360
We all have our individual talents,
and that just happens to be one of Zoë's.

1158
01:13:46,430 --> 01:13:50,924
Well, physically speaking,
Zoë is amazing.

1159
01:13:51,001 --> 01:13:53,663
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?

1160
01:13:54,505 --> 01:13:57,633
There's few human beings that can fuck
with Zoë on that front.

1161
01:13:57,708 --> 01:13:59,733
Kim, I like you too.

1162
01:14:00,678 --> 01:14:05,138
Having said that, before you get
too envious of Zoë's prowess,

1163
01:14:05,215 --> 01:14:07,944
you 're missing the most
important part of that story.

1164
01:14:08,017 --> 01:14:11,544
You didn't fall in the ditch.
Zoë did.

1165
01:14:11,621 --> 01:14:15,523
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

1166
01:14:15,591 --> 01:14:17,491
and she still fell in.

1167
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,654
So Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

1168
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:23,824
Hey, I resemble that remark.

1169
01:14:27,070 --> 01:14:29,163
So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?

1170
01:14:32,442 --> 01:14:34,273
Check it out, bitch.

1171
01:14:34,343 --> 01:14:36,709
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

1172
01:14:36,779 --> 01:14:37,973
What's a Roscoe?

1173
01:14:38,047 --> 01:14:39,344
Roscoe's a pistol.

1174
01:14:40,182 --> 01:14:42,116
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

1175
01:14:42,184 --> 01:14:44,175
You have a license to carry?

1176
01:14:44,252 --> 01:14:48,154
Yeah, when I became a Secret Service
agent, they gave me a license.

1177
01:14:48,890 --> 01:14:50,687
Oh, I didn't know you were...

1178
01:14:53,462 --> 01:14:57,523
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. God.

1179
01:14:58,633 --> 01:15:00,567
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

1180
01:15:00,635 --> 01:15:04,696
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

1181
01:15:04,773 --> 01:15:06,798
Do I know? Yes.

1182
01:15:06,875 --> 01:15:10,538
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

1183
01:15:10,612 --> 01:15:13,478
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

1184
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:17,142
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

1185
01:15:17,218 --> 01:15:19,948
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

1186
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:23,820
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down to the laundry room

1187
01:15:23,891 --> 01:15:26,792
at midnight enough times,
I might get my ass raped.

1188
01:15:26,861 --> 01:15:28,556
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

1189
01:15:28,629 --> 01:15:32,326
Fuck that! I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I want to.

1190
01:15:32,399 --> 01:15:36,665
There are other things you can carry
other than a gun. Pepper spray.

1191
01:15:36,737 --> 01:15:41,197
Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me,
I don't want to give him a skin rash.

1192
01:15:41,275 --> 01:15:43,072
I wanna shut that nigga down!

1193
01:15:44,945 --> 01:15:47,175
How about a knife, at least?

1194
01:15:47,247 --> 01:15:49,681
Yeah, you know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

1195
01:15:51,584 --> 01:15:53,484
They get shot!

1196
01:15:53,553 --> 01:15:57,580
If I ever become a famous actress,
I won't carry a gun.

1197
01:15:57,657 --> 01:16:01,320
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll
carry the gun, and when shit goes down,

1198
01:16:01,394 --> 01:16:04,795
I'll sit back and laugh,
but until that day, it's Wild West.

1199
01:16:04,864 --> 01:16:08,425
So Zoë, you thought about
what you want to do first?

1200
01:16:10,136 --> 01:16:13,765
It just so happens
I know exactly what I want to do.

1201
01:16:13,840 --> 01:16:17,276
Oh, really?
And what would that be?

1202
01:16:17,343 --> 01:16:22,041
To me, there's no point in being in America
unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.

1203
01:16:22,114 --> 01:16:26,380
I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger...
fuck me swinging, balls out.

1204
01:16:29,354 --> 01:16:31,914
Well, I guess we
could talk to Transpo,

1205
01:16:31,990 --> 01:16:34,390
but does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

1206
01:16:34,459 --> 01:16:38,953
Not just that. It has to be a 1970
Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.

1207
01:16:42,935 --> 01:16:46,063
How in the fuck
do you expect to do that?

1208
01:16:46,138 --> 01:16:47,469
No worries, mate.

1209
01:16:47,539 --> 01:16:49,769
I've got it all worked out.

1210
01:16:49,842 --> 01:16:53,073
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out

1211
01:16:53,145 --> 01:16:56,602
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

1212
01:16:56,681 --> 01:16:59,445
- So back home...
- I'm sorry, where's home? Australia?

1213
01:17:01,986 --> 01:17:04,181
What do you mean by that, mate?

1214
01:17:04,255 --> 01:17:07,315
Zoë's from New Zealand,
and you never...

1215
01:17:07,391 --> 01:17:10,849
I repeat, never...
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

1216
01:17:10,928 --> 01:17:13,624
That is, unless
you want your ass kicked.

1217
01:17:15,533 --> 01:17:17,330
I'm so sorry. I will nev...

1218
01:17:18,536 --> 01:17:20,094
Oh, it's okay.

1219
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:23,265
We're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

1220
01:17:23,341 --> 01:17:26,504
Auckland, to answer your question.

1221
01:17:26,577 --> 01:17:29,636
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

1222
01:17:29,713 --> 01:17:33,308
Why the fuck you want a local redneck
newspaper in New Zealand?

1223
01:17:33,383 --> 01:17:35,851
Pipe down and I'll tell you.

1224
01:17:35,919 --> 01:17:38,854
I've been getting the paper
and checking the classifieds,

1225
01:17:38,922 --> 01:17:40,514
looking at cars for sale,

1226
01:17:40,590 --> 01:17:45,254
so as of yesterday,
for sale in this town,

1227
01:17:45,328 --> 01:17:48,593
some dude is selling
a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger

1228
01:17:48,665 --> 01:17:52,431
with a 440 engine and a white paint job.

1229
01:17:52,502 --> 01:17:54,299
And you wanna buy it?

1230
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:59,235
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

1231
01:17:59,309 --> 01:18:03,335
I wanna say I wanna buy it
so he'll let me test-drive it.

1232
01:18:03,412 --> 01:18:06,540
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job?

1233
01:18:06,615 --> 01:18:08,173
Oh, uh, Kowalski!

1234
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:12,016
Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
Mate, it's a fucking classic!

1235
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:13,520
If I can get this guy

1236
01:18:13,589 --> 01:18:17,457
to let me drive it without him,
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

1237
01:18:17,526 --> 01:18:19,391
What's Vanishing Point?

1238
01:18:20,496 --> 01:18:22,464
What's Vanishing Point?

1239
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,500
Abs, I'm supposed
to be the illiterate one.

1240
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:28,536
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

1241
01:18:28,604 --> 01:18:32,131
Actually, Zoë, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.

1242
01:18:33,175 --> 01:18:37,201
Excuse me. Most girls?
What the fuck are you two?

1243
01:18:37,278 --> 01:18:40,770
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

1244
01:18:40,848 --> 01:18:43,214
Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.

1245
01:18:43,284 --> 01:18:45,616
Oh, I liked Pretty in Pink.

1246
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:48,155
What, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

1247
01:18:48,222 --> 01:18:52,249
Of course I did. I'm a girl.
But I also watched car shit, too...

1248
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:55,023
Vanishing Point. Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.

1249
01:18:55,096 --> 01:18:56,654
- Gone in 60 Seconds...
- Oh...

1250
01:18:56,731 --> 01:18:59,700
The real one, not that
Angelina Jolie bullshit.

1251
01:18:59,767 --> 01:19:03,498
We have an outdoor theater in Auckland
that plays Vanishing Point.

1252
01:19:03,571 --> 01:19:06,267
Big Wednesday, all the classics.

1253
01:19:22,856 --> 01:19:24,756
What do you horny gals want?

1254
01:19:28,362 --> 01:19:31,661
Yeah, you got
a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?

1255
01:19:31,732 --> 01:19:33,199
Right up here, ladies.

1256
01:19:47,813 --> 01:19:50,873
This shit is off the fuckin' hook!

1257
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:53,384
Fuckin' legendary, mate.

1258
01:19:55,621 --> 01:20:00,957
Sweet ass. Well, if you 'll excuse me,
I'd like to have a word with my associate.

1259
01:20:01,027 --> 01:20:02,517
You ladies take your time.

1260
01:20:09,368 --> 01:20:12,428
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

1261
01:20:12,505 --> 01:20:15,099
I intend to, but first I need
to ask you something.

1262
01:20:15,174 --> 01:20:16,266
What?

1263
01:20:16,342 --> 01:20:20,869
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play Ship's Mast.

1264
01:20:21,613 --> 01:20:23,342
- Oh, hell, no!
- Keep it down!

1265
01:20:23,415 --> 01:20:25,349
Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.

1266
01:20:25,417 --> 01:20:26,611
- For Chrissakes...
- Don't blaspheme.

1267
01:20:26,684 --> 01:20:27,673
Sorry.

1268
01:20:27,752 --> 01:20:30,516
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

1269
01:20:30,588 --> 01:20:33,853
- Look, I know what I said.
- What did you say?

1270
01:20:33,925 --> 01:20:36,018
- I know I said we shouldn't...
- No.

1271
01:20:36,094 --> 01:20:39,086
You didn't say we shouldn't.
You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.

1272
01:20:39,164 --> 01:20:40,927
- But...
- But, my ass!

1273
01:20:40,999 --> 01:20:44,025
You said not only are we never
gonna play Ship's Mast again,

1274
01:20:44,102 --> 01:20:47,162
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now,

1275
01:20:47,238 --> 01:20:52,140
to not only refuse, but that I had permission
to physically restrain your ass if necessary.

1276
01:20:52,209 --> 01:20:54,905
Now, did you or did you not say that?

1277
01:20:54,978 --> 01:20:58,243
No, no, no.
Answer the question, motherfucker.

1278
01:20:58,315 --> 01:21:01,751
- Did you or did you not say that?
- Yes, I said that.

1279
01:21:01,819 --> 01:21:03,753
- However...
- Whatever with your "however."

1280
01:21:03,821 --> 01:21:07,757
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it...

1281
01:21:07,825 --> 01:21:09,053
Damn skippy you meant it!

1282
01:21:09,126 --> 01:21:11,822
But when I said it,
I didn't mean in America!

1283
01:21:11,895 --> 01:21:13,920
- Oh, nigga, please.
- For real. Really.

1284
01:21:13,997 --> 01:21:18,024
I meant we should never play Ship's Mast
again in New Zealand or Australia.

1285
01:21:18,102 --> 01:21:19,797
You are such a liar!

1286
01:21:19,870 --> 01:21:25,467
I know what I said, but when I said it
I didn't know I'd ever come to America,

1287
01:21:25,542 --> 01:21:28,942
and if I had of known
I was gonna come to America,

1288
01:21:29,011 --> 01:21:32,674
had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast
on the Vanishing Point Challenger...

1289
01:21:32,748 --> 01:21:34,875
I would have added a "however."

1290
01:21:35,651 --> 01:21:36,640
Right?

1291
01:21:42,125 --> 01:21:44,389
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

1292
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:49,329
However, just because
you talked yourself into some stupid shit

1293
01:21:49,398 --> 01:21:51,525
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

1294
01:21:51,601 --> 01:21:54,832
You need two people to play Ship's Mast,
and I ain't playing.

1295
01:22:02,377 --> 01:22:04,504
I'll be your best friend.

1296
01:22:04,579 --> 01:22:07,480
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of Planet Earth.

1297
01:22:07,549 --> 01:22:08,846
I'll crack your back.

1298
01:22:08,917 --> 01:22:10,384
You'll crack it anyway.

1299
01:22:10,452 --> 01:22:13,182
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.

1300
01:22:13,255 --> 01:22:16,918
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

1301
01:22:16,992 --> 01:22:19,688
Whenever you want it, you've got it.
You don't even have to ask.

1302
01:22:19,761 --> 01:22:23,219
You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

1303
01:22:30,438 --> 01:22:34,874
You crack my back, give me foot massages,
and after a shower, you moisturize my butt.

1304
01:22:36,143 --> 01:22:37,132
Deal.

1305
01:22:38,946 --> 01:22:41,744
We're gonna see if this guy'll let us
take the car out without him.

1306
01:22:41,815 --> 01:22:44,807
If he does, you wait here with Lee
and we'll be back in a moment.

1307
01:22:45,386 --> 01:22:46,375
What?

1308
01:22:46,453 --> 01:22:50,856
- I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let...
- I heard what you said.

1309
01:22:50,925 --> 01:22:54,326
I just can't believe
what you said.

1310
01:22:55,663 --> 01:22:57,460
You two got some fuckin' balls.

1311
01:22:57,531 --> 01:22:58,964
What?

1312
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:00,523
Don't play dumbass with me.

1313
01:23:00,601 --> 01:23:05,595
I've been up all night, I'm still a little drunk,
and I have a hangover.

1314
01:23:05,673 --> 01:23:09,369
I should be in my hotel room, asleep,
not fuckin' around on Tobacco Road,

1315
01:23:09,442 --> 01:23:13,242
but because Zoë wanted to drive
some Vanishing Point car, I'm here.

1316
01:23:13,313 --> 01:23:17,272
Now you two got the balls to ask me...
no, scratch that... tell me

1317
01:23:17,350 --> 01:23:21,844
I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad
while the cool kids get to go out and play?

1318
01:23:21,921 --> 01:23:23,718
Bullshit on that.

1319
01:23:23,790 --> 01:23:25,815
- It ain't like that.
- What's it like, Kim?

1320
01:23:25,892 --> 01:23:29,794
You guys are our collateral.
He's never gonna go for it if we all go.

1321
01:23:29,862 --> 01:23:33,525
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

1322
01:23:34,367 --> 01:23:36,335
You're not gonna
want to do what we're doing.

1323
01:23:36,402 --> 01:23:37,733
What, drive a car?

1324
01:23:38,771 --> 01:23:39,863
We're doing more than that.

1325
01:23:39,939 --> 01:23:41,633
What, drive it fast?

1326
01:23:43,041 --> 01:23:44,702
We're doing more than that.

1327
01:23:44,776 --> 01:23:49,338
Actually, we're paying you a compliment,
'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.

1328
01:23:51,216 --> 01:23:53,810
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

1329
01:23:53,885 --> 01:23:56,319
But you got good sense,
and anybody with good sense

1330
01:23:56,388 --> 01:23:59,357
- ain't gonna want to do what we're doing.
- How do you know?

1331
01:23:59,424 --> 01:24:01,483
'Cause you're a mum.

1332
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:02,857
Yeah.

1333
01:24:05,530 --> 01:24:08,363
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,

1334
01:24:08,433 --> 01:24:12,335
but that's the excuse you guys use
whenever you want to exclude me,

1335
01:24:12,404 --> 01:24:15,270
so what is it you two daredevils are doing

1336
01:24:15,339 --> 01:24:19,605
that I'm just so uncool
I couldn't possibly understand?

1337
01:24:19,677 --> 01:24:22,077
You know, we're kind of conning this guy,

1338
01:24:22,146 --> 01:24:25,843
so maybe it's best if we don't go
into detail about it while he's watching us.

1339
01:24:25,916 --> 01:24:26,905
Besides...

1340
01:24:28,252 --> 01:24:30,812
he's probably not gonna
let us do it, anyway.

1341
01:24:33,691 --> 01:24:36,785
Okay, how about this?

1342
01:24:37,595 --> 01:24:40,758
I'll talk him into it,
but I go along.

1343
01:24:41,932 --> 01:24:44,730
- How you gonna do that?
- That's my problem.

1344
01:24:45,503 --> 01:24:46,663
But don't worry.

1345
01:24:47,538 --> 01:24:49,596
He'll say yes.

1346
01:24:49,673 --> 01:24:51,800
What are you gonna do, blow him?

1347
01:24:51,875 --> 01:24:53,035
No.

1348
01:24:54,411 --> 01:24:56,936
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

1349
01:25:01,117 --> 01:25:02,812
That's a good one.

1350
01:25:02,886 --> 01:25:04,251
Not really.

1351
01:25:05,288 --> 01:25:08,587
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

1352
01:25:12,929 --> 01:25:14,328
Okay, Mama, listen up.

1353
01:25:14,397 --> 01:25:18,128
You wanna hang with the cool kids?
You got to be cool.

1354
01:25:18,201 --> 01:25:21,034
We take you along, you don't say shit.
You don't even say crap.

1355
01:25:21,104 --> 01:25:24,129
You just sit in the back, and I don't want
to hear a peep, you understand?

1356
01:25:24,206 --> 01:25:25,605
- Got it.
- I'm serious, now.

1357
01:25:25,674 --> 01:25:29,508
You start nagging us, we pulling over,
kicking you out, and picking you up later.

1358
01:25:29,578 --> 01:25:30,909
Agreed.

1359
01:25:34,983 --> 01:25:38,009
Okay. Go work your magic.

1360
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,152
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

1361
01:25:46,228 --> 01:25:47,855
- Hello, what's your name?
- Jasper.

1362
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:49,625
Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.

1363
01:25:49,698 --> 01:25:51,325
- Aber what?
- Abernathy.

1364
01:25:51,400 --> 01:25:53,800
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

1365
01:25:53,869 --> 01:25:57,235
- What kind of first name is that?
- Just call me Abbie.

1366
01:25:57,305 --> 01:25:58,863
Okay, Abbie.

1367
01:26:00,007 --> 01:26:03,636
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I could take the car out

1368
01:26:03,711 --> 01:26:06,737
for a little test drive out on our own,
just to see if we're comfortable.

1369
01:26:06,814 --> 01:26:08,577
Why would I do something
stupid like that?

1370
01:26:08,649 --> 01:26:10,981
To better sell your automobile.

1371
01:26:11,052 --> 01:26:13,247
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

1372
01:26:13,321 --> 01:26:15,255
Four reasons, actually.

1373
01:26:15,323 --> 01:26:20,056
One, we're not thieves,
two, that would be rude,

1374
01:26:20,128 --> 01:26:22,790
three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town...

1375
01:26:22,864 --> 01:26:26,459
you can call, check with management.
We're registered for the next month.

1376
01:26:26,534 --> 01:26:31,197
Actually, Zoë's not, but Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.

1377
01:26:31,271 --> 01:26:33,000
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

1378
01:26:33,807 --> 01:26:37,402
Yes. Kim would be the girl of color.

1379
01:26:37,477 --> 01:26:39,877
And reason number four...
and the most important:

1380
01:26:39,946 --> 01:26:42,881
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin,

1381
01:26:42,949 --> 01:26:47,386
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted with our other friend...

1382
01:26:48,255 --> 01:26:49,415
Lee.

1383
01:26:52,692 --> 01:26:54,819
Why does she look
kind of familiar?

1384
01:26:54,895 --> 01:26:57,887
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

1385
01:26:57,964 --> 01:26:58,953
Hmm.

1386
01:26:59,933 --> 01:27:01,423
Why's she dressed like that?

1387
01:27:01,501 --> 01:27:04,663
Well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,

1388
01:27:04,737 --> 01:27:07,672
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

1389
01:27:07,740 --> 01:27:09,401
What's a cheerleader movie?

1390
01:27:09,475 --> 01:27:11,238
A movie about cheerleaders.

1391
01:27:12,478 --> 01:27:13,706
Is it a porno movie?

1392
01:27:15,481 --> 01:27:22,080
Yes, it is, but don't mention it. She's shy.

1393
01:27:25,691 --> 01:27:28,421
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

1394
01:27:28,494 --> 01:27:31,224
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

1395
01:27:31,297 --> 01:27:34,289
Hey, good-looking.
Be back to pick you up later.

1396
01:27:34,366 --> 01:27:35,697
Ta-ta!

1397
01:27:46,044 --> 01:27:47,477
Gulp.

1398
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,459
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1399
01:28:05,129 --> 01:28:06,528
I think I'm thinking it.

1400
01:28:06,598 --> 01:28:08,088
What are you and you thinking?

1401
01:28:08,166 --> 01:28:11,499
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

1402
01:28:14,171 --> 01:28:16,264
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

1403
01:28:16,340 --> 01:28:17,671
I gotta take a...

1404
01:28:34,992 --> 01:28:36,789
So, you ready to do this?

1405
01:28:38,328 --> 01:28:39,386
You sure?

1406
01:28:39,463 --> 01:28:44,127
Well, I always don't want to do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

1407
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:46,634
I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

1408
01:28:46,702 --> 01:28:47,828
Kim!

1409
01:28:47,904 --> 01:28:50,566
- I'm just saying.
- If you 're gonna take the piss out of it...

1410
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:52,301
I'm just saying.

1411
01:28:53,743 --> 01:28:55,370
You wanna start out on top?

1412
01:28:56,812 --> 01:29:00,145
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

1413
01:29:05,621 --> 01:29:06,815
Here are your gloves.

1414
01:29:13,996 --> 01:29:16,521
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing a jacket.

1415
01:29:16,599 --> 01:29:18,362
This is my jacket.

1416
01:29:18,434 --> 01:29:21,732
Um, ain't you supposed to be
my slave or some shit?

1417
01:29:22,837 --> 01:29:26,068
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the bonnet.

1418
01:29:26,141 --> 01:29:28,632
Bonnet, my ass.
You on the hood.

1419
01:29:37,953 --> 01:29:40,251
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.

1420
01:29:40,322 --> 01:29:41,516
Give me your belt.

1421
01:29:45,961 --> 01:29:51,297
This is my cute shit.
Fuck that. Get Abernathy's belt.

1422
01:29:53,134 --> 01:29:54,964
Fine, we'll use Abbie's belt.

1423
01:30:00,307 --> 01:30:03,105
- Give me your belt.
- No. Prada.

1424
01:30:03,177 --> 01:30:04,804
Come on, give her the belt.

1425
01:30:04,878 --> 01:30:08,609
- Magic word.
- Please give her the belt?

1426
01:30:09,650 --> 01:30:11,140
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

1427
01:30:13,854 --> 01:30:15,754
It's nice to be nice, Kim!

1428
01:30:15,823 --> 01:30:17,654
Whatever.

1429
01:30:17,725 --> 01:30:22,128
You know what?
Don't think about asking me to do your hair.

1430
01:30:22,196 --> 01:30:24,630
- Your ass gonna do it.
- You'll ask "pretty please," bitch,

1431
01:30:24,698 --> 01:30:27,564
because that's what you do when no one
else is looking. You ain't that hard.

1432
01:30:27,634 --> 01:30:29,568
- I ain't getting...
- Abernathy.

1433
01:30:29,636 --> 01:30:31,627
Don't get on my nerves right now.

1434
01:30:31,704 --> 01:30:34,138
- I got shit on my mind.
Ooh!

1435
01:30:34,207 --> 01:30:36,300
You know, I ain't six.

1436
01:30:49,255 --> 01:30:51,621
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

1437
01:30:51,691 --> 01:30:52,885
KIM and ZOË: No.

1438
01:30:54,427 --> 01:30:57,157
Okay, Abernathy. Check this out.

1439
01:31:08,940 --> 01:31:10,669
What the fuck are you guys doing?

1440
01:31:19,885 --> 01:31:21,318
What does that mean?

1441
01:31:23,355 --> 01:31:25,846
Whoa!

1442
01:31:29,795 --> 01:31:33,162
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!

1443
01:31:40,471 --> 01:31:42,769
That fast enough for your bony ass?

1444
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,569
Whoo-hoo!

1445
01:31:44,642 --> 01:31:47,202
Whoa ho ho ho!

1446
01:31:47,278 --> 01:31:48,267
Oh!

1447
01:31:50,614 --> 01:31:53,105
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

1448
01:31:57,755 --> 01:32:00,918
Whoa! Whoo-hoo!

1449
01:32:00,991 --> 01:32:02,583
Alrighty.

1450
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,821
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1451
01:32:17,307 --> 01:32:18,774
Go, go! Go!

1452
01:32:18,842 --> 01:32:21,538
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

1453
01:32:35,925 --> 01:32:37,153
Whoo-hoo!

1454
01:32:37,227 --> 01:32:39,195
Yah hoo hoo!

1455
01:32:48,203 --> 01:32:50,296
Yah hoo hoo!

1456
01:33:37,051 --> 01:33:40,748
- Oh, my God.
- What the fuck? Shit.

1457
01:33:47,028 --> 01:33:47,756
Damn it!

1458
01:33:56,736 --> 01:33:57,862
Now.

1459
01:33:59,206 --> 01:34:01,538
Did you do something to him?
Say something?

1460
01:34:01,608 --> 01:34:03,803
Nothing! Shit.

1461
01:34:03,877 --> 01:34:05,674
Here he comes, Zoë.
He's coming!

1462
01:34:05,745 --> 01:34:06,837
Aah!

1463
01:34:09,082 --> 01:34:10,310
Shit, oh shit!

1464
01:34:10,383 --> 01:34:11,816
No!

1465
01:34:12,686 --> 01:34:14,051
Hold on, Zoë!

1466
01:34:23,296 --> 01:34:25,229
Oh, my God. Zoë!

1467
01:34:25,464 --> 01:34:27,659
- Oh! Hold on!
- I can't!

1468
01:34:31,470 --> 01:34:33,199
Fuck you, motherfucker!

1469
01:34:34,907 --> 01:34:38,240
Zoë! Zoë!

1470
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:41,711
- I'm sorry I called you a black bitch!
- I forgive you. Hold the fuck on!

1471
01:34:41,780 --> 01:34:43,907
Whoa, whoa, get away!

1472
01:34:46,252 --> 01:34:48,914
Oh, shit.
I can't see. I can't see!

1473
01:34:48,988 --> 01:34:50,319
Zoë, move your leg!

1474
01:34:54,093 --> 01:34:56,027
Oh! Come on, come on!

1475
01:34:59,564 --> 01:35:03,091
Redneck lunatic bastard!
Get away from me!

1476
01:35:03,167 --> 01:35:04,156
fucking legs!

1477
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:10,765
Oh, my God.

1478
01:35:21,019 --> 01:35:23,920
Shit, I'm scared, Kim.
I'm really scared.

1479
01:35:23,988 --> 01:35:25,421
I know, baby, just hold on.

1480
01:35:25,490 --> 01:35:27,355
Watch your feet!

1481
01:35:29,827 --> 01:35:31,055
You wanna get hot?

1482
01:35:31,129 --> 01:35:32,993
- Fucking son of a bitch!
- You wanna get hot?

1483
01:35:34,164 --> 01:35:36,564
Then suck on this for a while, bitch!

1484
01:35:39,636 --> 01:35:42,070
Zoë! Goddamn it!

1485
01:36:08,064 --> 01:36:10,760
Oh, my God. Get away from us,
you cocksucker!

1486
01:36:10,833 --> 01:36:12,300
Leave us alone!

1487
01:36:12,368 --> 01:36:15,633
Fuck you, motherfucker!
Fuck you!

1488
01:36:19,942 --> 01:36:22,809
Zoë! Zoë! Oh, Zoë!

1489
01:36:24,046 --> 01:36:25,775
Hold on!

1490
01:36:47,902 --> 01:36:49,301
Zoë! Zoë!

1491
01:36:57,412 --> 01:36:58,504
Look out!

1492
01:37:27,074 --> 01:37:29,804
Get ready to fly, bitch.

1493
01:37:33,647 --> 01:37:35,308
- Zoë!
- Zoë, hold on!

1494
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:44,190
He's right on your fucking ass!

1495
01:38:00,073 --> 01:38:01,665
Hey! Whoo-hoo!

1496
01:38:02,575 --> 01:38:06,341
Hey, ladies, that was fun.

1497
01:38:10,716 --> 01:38:13,207
Well, adios.

1498
01:38:13,286 --> 01:38:15,550
Ow! Fuck!

1499
01:38:16,989 --> 01:38:18,422
Shit! Fuck!

1500
01:38:20,159 --> 01:38:22,718
Run away with your ass!

1501
01:38:23,862 --> 01:38:26,023
You better run, motherfucker!

1502
01:38:31,536 --> 01:38:33,163
That bitch!

1503
01:38:49,020 --> 01:38:50,146
I'm okay!

1504
01:38:50,222 --> 01:38:53,453
Oh, shit! Goddamn it!

1505
01:38:53,525 --> 01:38:56,084
Oh, you fuckin' bitch!

1506
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:59,823
Of course you are.
Of course you are. What was I thinking?

1507
01:39:01,165 --> 01:39:04,225
What was I thinking?
Zoë, the fucking cat!

1508
01:39:08,339 --> 01:39:10,307
Whew. That was a close one.

1509
01:39:13,677 --> 01:39:16,441
So, where's the maniac?

1510
01:39:16,514 --> 01:39:19,381
I shot him and his punk ass sped off.

1511
01:39:20,484 --> 01:39:22,748
You wanna go get him?

1512
01:39:22,820 --> 01:39:24,845
Oh, hell yeah!

1513
01:39:24,922 --> 01:39:25,911
Honey...

1514
01:39:26,790 --> 01:39:28,757
I think you might want to get out.

1515
01:39:29,893 --> 01:39:31,360
Fuck that shit.

1516
01:39:32,595 --> 01:39:34,495
Let's kill this bastard.

1517
01:39:36,466 --> 01:39:38,832
Okay, get your ass in the back.
Let's go.

1518
01:39:45,008 --> 01:39:46,498
Where the fuck you going?

1519
01:39:46,576 --> 01:39:47,565
I'll be back!

1520
01:39:55,885 --> 01:39:58,615
This'll smart. Sweet. Let's go.

1521
01:39:58,688 --> 01:40:02,453
Oh, fuck yeah, bitch.
Come on. Bring that shit.

1522
01:40:04,626 --> 01:40:05,888
Giddy-up, then!

1523
01:40:14,203 --> 01:40:15,636
Yeah!

1524
01:40:46,834 --> 01:40:48,028
God!

1525
01:40:59,513 --> 01:41:02,004
Come on! Come on.

1526
01:41:10,757 --> 01:41:15,558
Why? Oh, no!

1527
01:41:20,867 --> 01:41:22,357
Ah! Do it.

1528
01:41:23,370 --> 01:41:24,769
Do it.

1529
01:41:24,938 --> 01:41:25,927
Do it.

1530
01:41:31,478 --> 01:41:34,413
Oh, no!

1531
01:41:34,481 --> 01:41:36,642
No, no, no!

1532
01:41:36,716 --> 01:41:38,707
No, God!

1533
01:41:39,352 --> 01:41:41,377
All right, get it together, man.

1534
01:41:43,657 --> 01:41:46,216
What did you...
what am I... what are you gonna do?

1535
01:41:52,631 --> 01:41:54,098
Take him down!

1536
01:41:57,603 --> 01:42:00,504
Now where do you think you're going?
Fuckin' fuck you!

1537
01:42:00,572 --> 01:42:02,472
Where do you think
you're fucking going?

1538
01:42:02,541 --> 01:42:04,406
What the fuck do you think...

1539
01:42:07,880 --> 01:42:08,869
Come here!

1540
01:42:16,455 --> 01:42:17,444
