1
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:41,927
While I'm very familiar
with you and your family,

2
00:07:42,011 --> 00:07:45,681
I have no way of knowing if
you are familiar with who I am.

3
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,851
Are you aware of my existence?

4
00:07:49,853 --> 00:07:50,853
Yes.

5
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,020
This is good.

6
00:07:52,605 --> 00:07:56,692
Now, are you aware of the job I've
been ordered to carry out in France?

7
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,070
Yes.

8
00:08:00,738 --> 00:08:02,739
Please tell me what you've heard.

9
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,033
I've heard

10
00:08:05,577 --> 00:08:09,872
that the Führer has put you in charge
of rounding up the Jews left in France

11
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,875
who are either hiding
or passing for Gentile.

12
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,212
The Führer couldn't have
said it better himself.

13
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:22,801
But the meaning of your visit,

14
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:27,473
pleasant though it is,
is mysterious to me.

15
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:32,394
The Germans looked through my house
nine months ago for hiding Jews

16
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,146
and found nothing.

17
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:37,566
I'm aware of that.

18
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:40,569
I've read the reports of this area.

19
00:08:42,572 --> 00:08:45,782
But like any enterprise,
when under new management,

20
00:08:45,867 --> 00:08:48,952
there is always a slight
duplication of efforts,

21
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:54,875
most of it being a complete waste of
time, but needs to be done nevertheless.

22
00:08:55,877 --> 00:08:58,921
I just have a few
questions, monsieur LaPadite.

23
00:09:00,423 --> 00:09:02,674
If you can assist me with answers,

24
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,886
my department can close
the file on your family.

25
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:15,521
Now,

26
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:21,443
before the occupation, there were
four Jewish families in this area,

27
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,363
all dairy farmers like yourself.

28
00:09:26,199 --> 00:09:30,786
Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts

29
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:34,289
and the Dreyfuses.

30
00:09:34,457 --> 00:09:35,999
Is that correct?

31
00:09:36,084 --> 00:09:37,084
To my knowledge,

32
00:09:37,168 --> 00:09:40,629
those were the Jewish families
among the dairy farmers.

33
00:09:40,797 --> 00:09:44,633
Herr Colonel, would it
disturb you if I smoked my pipe?

34
00:09:44,717 --> 00:09:46,176
Please, monsieur LaPadite,

35
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:49,263
this is your house, make
yourself comfortable.

36
00:09:49,597 --> 00:09:52,558
Now, according to these papers,

37
00:09:53,476 --> 00:09:56,895
all the Jewish families in this
area have been accounted for

38
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,815
except the Dreyfuses.

39
00:10:01,276 --> 00:10:04,695
Somewhere in the last year it
would appear they've vanished.

40
00:10:04,779 --> 00:10:08,073
Which leads me to the conclusion that
they've either made good their escape

41
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:11,076
or someone is very
successfully hiding them.

42
00:10:12,287 --> 00:10:15,914
What have you heard about the
Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?

43
00:10:15,999 --> 00:10:16,957
Only rumors.

44
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:18,333
I love rumors!

45
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,253
Facts could be so misleading,

46
00:10:21,337 --> 00:10:24,506
where rumors, true or
false, are often revealing.

47
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:26,383
So, monsieur LaPadite,

48
00:10:26,467 --> 00:10:29,720
what rumors have you heard
regarding the Dreyfuses?

49
00:10:32,557 --> 00:10:35,684
Again, this is just a rumor,

50
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:42,065
but we heard the Dreyfuses
had made their way into Spain.

51
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,659
So, the rumors you've
heard have been of escape?

52
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,454
Yes.

53
00:10:59,042 --> 00:11:02,794
Having never met the Dreyfuses,
would you confirm for me

54
00:11:02,879 --> 00:11:06,173
the exact members of the
household and their names?

55
00:11:11,596 --> 00:11:13,555
There were five of them.

56
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,435
The father, Jacob.

57
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,814
Wife, Miram.

58
00:11:24,859 --> 00:11:28,445
And her brother, Bob.

59
00:11:35,703 --> 00:11:37,245
How old is Bob?

60
00:11:38,873 --> 00:11:40,207
Thirty, 31.

61
00:11:44,462 --> 00:11:45,712
Continue.

62
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:47,714
And the children,

63
00:11:49,425 --> 00:11:50,550
Amos

64
00:11:52,637 --> 00:11:54,096
and Shosanna.

65
00:11:56,265 --> 00:11:58,100
Ages of the children?

66
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:08,777
Amos was nine or 10.

67
00:12:11,614 --> 00:12:12,906
And Shosanna?

68
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:15,117
And Shosanna was

69
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:20,580
18 or 19. I'm not really sure.

70
00:12:31,426 --> 00:12:33,760
Well, I guess that should do it.

71
00:12:40,143 --> 00:12:44,563
However, before I go, could I have
another glass of your delicious milk?

72
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,109
But of course.

73
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:57,909
Monsieur LaPadite,

74
00:12:57,994 --> 00:13:01,997
are you aware of the nickname the
people of France have given me?

75
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,044
I have no interest in such things.

76
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,798
But you are aware of what they call me.

77
00:13:14,343 --> 00:13:15,677
I'm aware.

78
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,306
What are you aware of?

79
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,734
That they call you "The Jew Hunter."

80
00:13:30,818 --> 00:13:32,360
Precisely.

81
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:37,324
I understand your
trepidation in repeating it.

82
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,701
Heydrich apparently hates the moniker

83
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:42,454
the good people of Prague
have bestowed on him.

84
00:13:42,538 --> 00:13:45,791
Actually, why he would hate the
name "the Hangman" is baffling to me.

85
00:13:45,875 --> 00:13:49,211
lt would appear he has done
everything in his power to earn it.

86
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,547
Now I, on the other hand,
love my unofficial title

87
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:55,050
precisely because I've earned it.

88
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:00,514
The feature that makes me such an
effective hunter of the Jews is,

89
00:14:00,598 --> 00:14:03,308
as opposed to most German soldiers,

90
00:14:03,392 --> 00:14:05,393
I can think like a Jew

91
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:08,772
where they can only think like a German.

92
00:14:09,148 --> 00:14:11,566
More
precisely, a German soldier.

93
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:23,203
Now, if one were to determine what attribute
the German people share with a beast,

94
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:27,290
it would be the cunning and the
predatory instinct of a hawk.

95
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:31,586
But if one were to determine what
attributes the Jews share with a beast,

96
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,797
it would be that of the rat.

97
00:14:36,592 --> 00:14:40,428
The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda
have said pretty much the same thing.

98
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:43,515
But where our conclusions differ,

99
00:14:43,599 --> 00:14:46,601
is I don't consider the
comparison an insult.

100
00:14:49,105 --> 00:14:52,941
Consider for a moment
the world a rat lives in.

101
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,069
It's a hostile world, indeed.

102
00:14:56,904 --> 00:15:00,282
If a rat were to scamper through
your front door, right now,

103
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,784
would you greet it with hostility?

104
00:15:03,786 --> 00:15:05,620
I suppose I would.

105
00:15:05,705 --> 00:15:07,247
Has a rat ever done anything to you

106
00:15:07,331 --> 00:15:10,625
to create this animosity
you feel toward them?

107
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:14,170
Rats spread disease. They bite people.

108
00:15:14,714 --> 00:15:18,508
Rats were the cause of the bubonic
plague, but that's some time ago.

109
00:15:18,593 --> 00:15:21,219
I propose to you any
disease a rat could spread,

110
00:15:21,304 --> 00:15:23,763
a squirrel could equally carry.

111
00:15:23,848 --> 00:15:25,432
Would you agree?

112
00:15:27,310 --> 00:15:29,895
Yet, I assume you don't share
the same animosity with squirrels

113
00:15:29,979 --> 00:15:31,980
that you do with rats, do you?

114
00:15:32,064 --> 00:15:33,064
No.

115
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,650
Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?

116
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:39,738
And except for the tail, they
even rather look alike, don't they?

117
00:15:40,156 --> 00:15:42,991
It's an interesting
thought, Herr Colonel.

118
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:45,744
However interesting
as the thought may be,

119
00:15:45,828 --> 00:15:49,080
it makes not one bit of
difference to how you feel.

120
00:15:51,417 --> 00:15:55,503
If a rat were to walk in
here, right now, as I'm talking

121
00:15:56,631 --> 00:16:00,467
would you greet it with a
saucer of your delicious milk?

122
00:16:00,551 --> 00:16:02,010
Probably not.

123
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,387
I didn't think so.

124
00:16:05,014 --> 00:16:06,556
You don't like them.

125
00:16:06,641 --> 00:16:08,516
You don't really know
why you don't like them.

126
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:11,353
All you know is you find them repulsive.

127
00:16:13,564 --> 00:16:16,608
Consequently, a German
soldier conducts a search

128
00:16:16,692 --> 00:16:19,235
of a house suspected of hiding Jews.

129
00:16:20,154 --> 00:16:21,738
Where does the hawk look?

130
00:16:21,822 --> 00:16:24,991
He looks in the barn, he looks in
the attic, he looks in the cellar,

131
00:16:25,076 --> 00:16:27,535
he looks everywhere he would hide.

132
00:16:28,496 --> 00:16:32,666
But there are so many places it
would never occur to a hawk to hide.

133
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:38,588
However, the reason the Führer has
brought me off my Alps in Austria

134
00:16:38,673 --> 00:16:43,093
and placed me in French cow country
today is because it does occur to me.

135
00:16:44,345 --> 00:16:47,681
Because I'm aware what tremendous
feats human beings are capable of

136
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:49,808
once they abandon dignity.

137
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,728
May I smoke my pipe as well?

138
00:16:56,065 --> 00:16:58,942
Please, Herr Colonel,
make yourself at home.

139
00:17:11,706 --> 00:17:16,751
Now, my job dictates

140
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:24,759
that I must have my men enter your home

141
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:30,557
and conduct a thorough search

142
00:17:30,641 --> 00:17:34,436
before I can officially cross
your family's name off my list.

143
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:39,065
And if there are any irregularities to
be found, rest assured they will be.

144
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,359
That is unless you have
something to tell me

145
00:17:41,444 --> 00:17:44,487
that makes the conducting
of a search unnecessary.

146
00:17:44,572 --> 00:17:46,823
I might add, also, that any information

147
00:17:46,907 --> 00:17:51,578
that makes the performance of my duty
easier will not be met with punishment.

148
00:17:52,413 --> 00:17:55,957
Actually, quite the contrary.
It will be met with reward.

149
00:17:56,459 --> 00:17:57,751
And that reward will be,

150
00:17:57,835 --> 00:18:00,628
your family will cease
to be harassed in any way

151
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:05,133
by the German military during the
rest of our occupation of your country.

152
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:19,147
You're sheltering enemies
of the state, are you not?

153
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:25,570
Yes.

154
00:18:28,491 --> 00:18:32,410
You're sheltering them underneath
your floorboards, aren't you?

155
00:18:34,955 --> 00:18:35,997
Yes.

156
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,878
Point out to me the areas
where they're hiding.

157
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,275
Since I haven't heard any disturbance,

158
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,071
I assume, while they're listening,
they don't speak English.

159
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:11,032
Yes.

160
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,954
I'm going to switch back to French now,
and I want you to follow my masquerade.

161
00:19:16,038 --> 00:19:17,497
ls that clear?

162
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:20,542
Yes.

163
00:20:22,479 --> 00:20:23,605
It's the girl.

164
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,403
Au revoir, Shosanna!

165
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:29,212
Ten-hut!

166
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,971
My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.

167
00:21:38,055 --> 00:21:42,016
And I'm putting together a special
team, and I need me eight soldiers.

168
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:45,228
Eight Jewish American soldiers.

169
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,774
Now, you all might've heard rumors
about the armada happening soon.

170
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:52,568
Well, we'll be leaving
a little earlier.

171
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:57,073
We're going to be dropped into
France dressed as civilians.

172
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,993
Once we're in enemy territory,

173
00:22:00,619 --> 00:22:02,578
as a bushwhacking guerrilla army,

174
00:22:02,663 --> 00:22:06,040
we're going to be doing one
thing and one thing only.

175
00:22:06,583 --> 00:22:08,042
Killing Nazis.

176
00:22:10,045 --> 00:22:11,629
I don't know about you all,

177
00:22:11,714 --> 00:22:14,632
but I sure as hell didn't come down
from the goddamn Smoky Mountains,

178
00:22:14,717 --> 00:22:18,636
cross 5,000 miles of water,
fight my way through half of Sicily

179
00:22:18,721 --> 00:22:23,141
and jump out of a fucking airplane to
teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.

180
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:25,310
Nazi ain't got no humanity.

181
00:22:26,061 --> 00:22:29,564
They're the foot soldiers of a
Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac

182
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,899
and they need to be destroyed.

183
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:36,612
That's why any and every son of a
bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform,

184
00:22:37,072 --> 00:22:38,906
they're going to die.

185
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:45,288
Now, I'm the direct descendent
of the mountain man Jim Bridger.

186
00:22:45,372 --> 00:22:47,498
That means I got a little lndian in me.

187
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:51,836
And our battle plan will be
that of an Apache resistance.

188
00:22:52,921 --> 00:22:55,256
We will be cruel to the Germans.

189
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:58,926
And through our cruelty,
they will know who we are.

190
00:22:59,094 --> 00:23:01,346
And they will find the
evidence of our cruelty

191
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,348
in the disemboweled, dismembered

192
00:23:03,432 --> 00:23:07,101
and disfigured bodies of their
brothers we leave behind us.

193
00:23:07,269 --> 00:23:09,687
And the German won't be
able to help themselves

194
00:23:09,772 --> 00:23:13,524
but imagine the cruelty their
brothers endured at our hands,

195
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,612
and our boot heels and
the edge of our knives.

196
00:23:18,989 --> 00:23:21,366
And the German will be sickened by us.

197
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:23,659
And the German will talk about us.

198
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:25,953
And the German will fear us.

199
00:23:26,455 --> 00:23:28,956
And when the German
closes their eyes at night

200
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,335
and they're tortured by their
subconscious for the evil they have done,

201
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:36,130
it will be with thoughts of
us that they are tortured with.

202
00:23:37,674 --> 00:23:38,841
Sound good?

203
00:23:38,926 --> 00:23:40,551
Yes, sir!

204
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,679
That's what I like to hear.

205
00:23:43,889 --> 00:23:47,725
But I got a word of warning
for all you would-be warriors.

206
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,686
When you join my command,
you take on debit.

207
00:23:51,105 --> 00:23:53,689
A debit you owe me, personally.

208
00:23:55,692 --> 00:24:00,279
Each and every man under my
command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.

209
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,824
And I want my scalps.

210
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,913
And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps
taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.

211
00:24:10,499 --> 00:24:12,417
Or you will die trying!

212
00:26:54,538 --> 00:26:56,205
Hey, Hirschberg.

213
00:26:56,957 --> 00:26:58,666
Send that Kraut sarge over.

214
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:00,251
You. Go.

215
00:27:33,994 --> 00:27:36,037
Sergeant Werner Rachtman.

216
00:27:36,997 --> 00:27:39,540
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
Pleased to meet you.

217
00:27:40,083 --> 00:27:42,126
You know what "sit down" means, Werner?

218
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,003
Yes. Then sit down.

219
00:27:47,674 --> 00:27:48,758
How is your English, Werner?

220
00:27:48,842 --> 00:27:51,802
Because if need be, we got a
couple of fellows who can translate.

221
00:27:51,887 --> 00:27:52,970
Wicki here,

222
00:27:53,055 --> 00:27:56,307
an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out
of Munich while the getting was good.

223
00:27:56,391 --> 00:28:00,311
Became American, got drafted,
come back to give y'all what for.

224
00:28:00,854 --> 00:28:03,481
Another one up there you
might be familiar with.

225
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,483
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.

226
00:28:07,569 --> 00:28:09,070
Heard of him?

227
00:28:09,404 --> 00:28:13,074
Everybody in the German Army
has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.

228
00:28:23,752 --> 00:28:25,711
The reason
for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity

229
00:28:25,796 --> 00:28:27,922
among German soldiers is simple.

230
00:28:28,006 --> 00:28:33,678
As a German-enlisted man,
he killed 13 Gestapo officers.

231
00:28:47,943 --> 00:28:50,945
Instead of putting
him up against a wall,

232
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:53,864
the High Command decided
to send him back to Berlin

233
00:28:53,949 --> 00:28:55,449
to be made an example of.

234
00:28:56,993 --> 00:29:00,746
Needless to say, once the
Basterds heard about him,

235
00:29:01,081 --> 00:29:02,748
he never got there.

236
00:29:39,661 --> 00:29:41,537
Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?

237
00:29:44,207 --> 00:29:46,917
Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
These are the Basterds.

238
00:29:47,002 --> 00:29:48,669
Ever heard of us?

239
00:29:50,672 --> 00:29:53,257
We just want to say we're
a big fan of your work.

240
00:29:53,341 --> 00:29:54,467
When it comes to killing Nazis...

241
00:29:57,721 --> 00:29:59,972
... I think you show great talent.

242
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:03,851
And I pride myself for having
an eye for that kind of talent.

243
00:30:07,355 --> 00:30:10,524
But your status as a Nazi
killer is still amateur.

244
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:14,612
We all come here to see
if you want to go pro.

245
00:30:21,453 --> 00:30:23,746
Can I assume you know who we are?

246
00:30:23,830 --> 00:30:25,164
You're Aldo the Apache.

247
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,001
Werner, if you heard of us,

248
00:30:29,085 --> 00:30:31,754
you probably heard we ain't in
the prisoner-taking business.

249
00:30:31,838 --> 00:30:35,758
We in the killing Nazi business,
and, cousin, business is a-booming.

250
00:30:35,842 --> 00:30:37,134
Oh, yeah.

251
00:30:37,719 --> 00:30:40,262
Now, that leaves two
ways we can play this out.

252
00:30:40,347 --> 00:30:42,556
Either kill you or let you go.

253
00:30:43,099 --> 00:30:45,184
Whether or not you're going
to leave this ditch alive

254
00:30:45,268 --> 00:30:47,228
depends entirely on you.

255
00:30:51,566 --> 00:30:54,318
Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.

256
00:30:54,736 --> 00:30:59,156
Besides you, we know there's another
Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.

257
00:31:00,033 --> 00:31:02,159
If that patrol were to
have any crack shots,

258
00:31:02,244 --> 00:31:05,204
that orchard would be a
goddamn sniper's delight.

259
00:31:06,414 --> 00:31:09,750
So if you ever want to eat
a sauerkraut sandwich again,

260
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,672
you got to show me on this
here map where they are.

261
00:31:15,549 --> 00:31:18,884
You got to tell me how many
they are, and you got to tell me

262
00:31:18,969 --> 00:31:21,428
what kind of artillery
they're carrying with them.

263
00:31:22,931 --> 00:31:27,142
You can't expect me to divulge information
that would put German lives in danger.

264
00:31:28,186 --> 00:31:32,189
Well, now, Werner, that's where you're
wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.

265
00:31:32,941 --> 00:31:35,150
I need to know about
Germans hiding in trees.

266
00:31:35,235 --> 00:31:38,404
And you need to tell me. And
you need to tell me right now.

267
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:41,115
Now, just take that finger of yours

268
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:44,535
and point out on this here map
where this party is being held,

269
00:31:44,619 --> 00:31:47,997
how many is coming and what
they brought to play with.

270
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:57,381
I respectfully refuse, sir.

271
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:01,051
Hear that?

272
00:32:02,345 --> 00:32:03,429
Yes.

273
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:08,851
That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.

274
00:32:09,144 --> 00:32:11,854
You might know him
better by his nickname.

275
00:32:11,938 --> 00:32:13,689
The Bear Jew.

276
00:32:14,774 --> 00:32:18,777
Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache,
you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.

277
00:32:18,862 --> 00:32:20,112
I heard of The Bear Jew.

278
00:32:20,196 --> 00:32:21,822
What did you hear?

279
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:25,326
Beats German soldiers with a club.

280
00:32:25,785 --> 00:32:29,496
He bashes their brains in with
a baseball bat, what he does.

281
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:31,916
And, Werner, I'm going to
ask you one last goddamn time,

282
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,876
and if you still respectfully refuse,

283
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,003
I'm calling The Bear Jew over.

284
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:38,005
He's going to take that big bat of his,

285
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,258
and he's going to beat
your ass to death with it.

286
00:32:44,554 --> 00:32:46,388
Now, take your
Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger,

287
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:49,475
and point out on this
map what I want to know.

288
00:32:57,567 --> 00:32:58,859
Fuck you.

289
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:00,945
And your Jew dogs.

290
00:33:04,908 --> 00:33:06,867
Actually, Werner, we're all
tickled to hear you say that.

291
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,827
Quite frankly, watching
Donny beat Nazis to death

292
00:33:08,912 --> 00:33:11,789
is the closest we ever get
to going to the movies. Donny!

293
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:12,998
Yeah?

294
00:33:13,083 --> 00:33:15,626
Got us a German here who
wants to die for country.

295
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,044
Oblige him.

296
00:34:23,611 --> 00:34:26,113
Did you get that for killing Jews?

297
00:34:26,281 --> 00:34:27,573
Bravery.

298
00:34:44,132 --> 00:34:45,257
Yeah!

299
00:34:47,886 --> 00:34:50,220
- Oh, no!
- Oh, no!

300
00:34:50,305 --> 00:34:51,472
Donny!

301
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,223
Yeah, Donny!

302
00:34:53,475 --> 00:34:56,226
About now I'd be shitting
my pants if I was you.

303
00:34:57,729 --> 00:35:00,397
Teddy Fucking Williams
knocks it out of the park!

304
00:35:00,482 --> 00:35:04,068
Fenway Park is on its feet
for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!

305
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:08,072
He went yard on that one, on
to fucking Lansdowne Street!

306
00:35:08,156 --> 00:35:09,239
You!

307
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,161
Damn it, Hirschberg!

308
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:17,164
Donny, bring that other
one over here. Alive!

309
00:35:17,457 --> 00:35:20,375
Get the fuck up! Batter
up. You're on deck!

310
00:35:20,668 --> 00:35:23,378
Two hits. I hit you,
you hit the ground.

311
00:35:24,422 --> 00:35:25,589
English?

312
00:35:26,716 --> 00:35:27,883
Wicki.

313
00:35:31,513 --> 00:35:33,472
Ask him if he wants to live.

314
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:38,018
Tell him to point out on
this map the German position.

315
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,566
Ask him how many Germans.

316
00:35:47,028 --> 00:35:48,654
Around about 12.

317
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:50,197
What kind of artillery?

318
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,544
Now, when you report what happened here,

319
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,297
you can't tell them you told us
what you told us. They'll shoot you.

320
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:11,301
They're going to want to know why
you so special, we let you live.

321
00:36:11,386 --> 00:36:15,055
So tell them, we let you live so you
could spread the word through the ranks

322
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:17,599
what's going to happen
to every Nazi we find.

323
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:43,417
Now that you've survived the war, when
you get home, what you going to do?

324
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:51,758
WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother.

325
00:36:53,928 --> 00:36:55,679
Well, ain't that nice?

326
00:36:55,889 --> 00:36:57,598
Ask if he's going to
take off his uniform.

327
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,563
He's going to burn it.

328
00:37:04,856 --> 00:37:07,566
Yeah, that's what we
thought. We don't like that.

329
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:12,529
See, we like our Nazis in
uniforms. That way you can spot them.

330
00:37:12,614 --> 00:37:14,156
Just like that.

331
00:37:18,786 --> 00:37:23,040
But you take off that uniform, ain't
nobody going to know you's a Nazi.

332
00:37:23,124 --> 00:37:25,292
And that don't sit well with us.

333
00:37:30,465 --> 00:37:33,967
So I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.

334
00:37:46,147 --> 00:37:49,816
You know, Lieutenant, you're
getting pretty good at that.

335
00:37:50,276 --> 00:37:53,445
You know how you get to
Carnegie Hall, don't you?

336
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,656
Practice.

337
00:54:18,263 --> 00:54:20,598
Au revoir, Shosanna!

338
01:02:35,009 --> 01:02:39,388
At that time, 35
millimeter nitrate film was so flammable

339
01:02:39,472 --> 01:02:42,516
that you couldn't even bring
a reel onto a streetcar.

340
01:02:42,726 --> 01:02:44,435
Hey, you can't bring those
here on a public vehicle.

341
01:02:44,519 --> 01:02:45,936
They're films, ain't they? Yes.

342
01:02:46,020 --> 01:02:47,688
Then they're flammable. Go on, hop off.

343
01:02:47,856 --> 01:02:51,692
Because nitrate film
burns three times faster than paper.

344
01:02:55,321 --> 01:02:57,364
Shosanna has a collection

345
01:02:57,449 --> 01:03:02,494
of over 350 nitrate film prints.

346
01:04:14,067 --> 01:04:16,235
Right this way, Lieutenant.

347
01:04:36,422 --> 01:04:39,091
Lieutenant Archie Hicox
reporting, sir.

348
01:04:39,175 --> 01:04:41,969
General Ed Fenech. At ease, Hicox.

349
01:04:42,804 --> 01:04:44,012
Drink?

350
01:04:45,765 --> 01:04:49,977
If you offer me a scotch and plain water,
I could drink a scotch and plain water.

351
01:04:50,061 --> 01:04:53,647
That-a-boy, Lieutenant. Make it
yourself like a good chap, will you?

352
01:04:53,731 --> 01:04:55,732
The bar is in the globe.

353
01:05:00,113 --> 01:05:02,197
Something for yourself, sir?

354
01:05:02,282 --> 01:05:05,450
Whiskey. Straight. No junk in it.

355
01:05:06,703 --> 01:05:09,621
lt says here that you
speak German fluently.

356
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,665
Like a Katzenjammer Kid.

357
01:05:11,749 --> 01:05:14,376
And your occupation before the war?

358
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:15,627
I'm a film critic.

359
01:05:16,254 --> 01:05:18,213
List your accomplishments.

360
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:20,173
Well, sir, such as they are,

361
01:05:20,258 --> 01:05:24,803
I write reviews and articles for a
publication called Films and Filmmakers,

362
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:27,306
and I've had two books published.

363
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:31,226
Impressive. Don't be modest,
Lieutenant. What are their titles?

364
01:05:31,311 --> 01:05:32,311
The first book was called

365
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:36,899
Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind:
A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.

366
01:05:36,983 --> 01:05:40,819
And the second one was called
Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.

367
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:46,241
It's a sub textual film criticism study
of the work of German director G.W. Pabst.

368
01:05:46,743 --> 01:05:48,327
What should we drink to, sir?

369
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:49,661
Well...

370
01:05:50,914 --> 01:05:52,873
Down with Hitler.

371
01:05:52,957 --> 01:05:54,333
All the way down, sir.

372
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:55,959
Yes.

373
01:05:59,672 --> 01:06:03,759
Are you familiar with German
cinema under the Third Reich?

374
01:06:05,637 --> 01:06:09,848
Yes. Obviously, I haven't seen any of
the films made in the last three years,

375
01:06:09,933 --> 01:06:12,184
but I'm familiar with it.

376
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:13,310
Explain it to me.

377
01:06:13,978 --> 01:06:15,020
Pardon, sir?

378
01:06:15,104 --> 01:06:19,358
Well, this little escapade of ours requires
a knowledge of the German film industry

379
01:06:19,442 --> 01:06:24,613
under the Third Reich. Explain
to me UFA under Goebbels.

380
01:06:26,783 --> 01:06:29,159
Goebbels considers the films he's making

381
01:06:29,243 --> 01:06:32,496
to be the beginning of a
new era in German cinema.

382
01:06:32,956 --> 01:06:34,623
An alternative to what he considers

383
01:06:34,707 --> 01:06:37,668
the Jewish-German intellectual
cinema of the '20s,

384
01:06:38,378 --> 01:06:41,046
and the Jewish-controlled
dogma of Hollywood.

385
01:06:41,130 --> 01:06:42,714
How's he doing?

386
01:06:43,257 --> 01:06:45,842
Frightfully sorry, sir. Once again?

387
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:50,889
You say he wants to take on
the Jews at their own game.

388
01:06:51,891 --> 01:06:54,893
Well, compared to, say, Louis B. Mayer,

389
01:06:55,728 --> 01:06:57,980
how's he doing?

390
01:06:58,064 --> 01:06:59,314
Quite well, actually.

391
01:06:59,983 --> 01:07:01,566
Since Goebbels has taken over,

392
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:06,071
film attendance has steadily risen
in Germany over the last eight years.

393
01:07:06,155 --> 01:07:09,616
But Louis B. Mayer wouldn't be
Goebbels' proper opposite number.

394
01:07:09,701 --> 01:07:13,495
I believe Goebbels sees himself
closer to David O. Selznick.

395
01:07:17,917 --> 01:07:19,292
Brief him.

396
01:07:19,627 --> 01:07:24,673
Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time
I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.

397
01:07:25,258 --> 01:07:26,383
Three days from now

398
01:07:26,467 --> 01:07:30,804
Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala
premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.

399
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,014
What film, sir?

400
01:07:32,098 --> 01:07:34,766
The motion picture is
called Nation's Pride.

401
01:07:35,727 --> 01:07:39,104
In attendance at this
joyous Germatic occasion

402
01:07:39,188 --> 01:07:43,608
will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann,
and most of the German High Command

403
01:07:43,693 --> 01:07:47,446
including all high ranking officers
of both the SS and the Gestapo,

404
01:07:47,530 --> 01:07:50,949
as well as luminaries of the
Nazi propaganda film industry.

405
01:07:51,034 --> 01:07:53,118
The master race at play?

406
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:57,372
Basically, we have all our
rotten eggs in one basket.

407
01:07:57,457 --> 01:08:00,000
The objective of Operation Kino,

408
01:08:00,918 --> 01:08:02,669
blow up the basket.

409
01:08:03,463 --> 01:08:07,549
And like the snows of
yesteryear, gone from this earth.

410
01:08:08,468 --> 01:08:10,135
Jolly good, sir.

411
01:08:10,887 --> 01:08:14,389
An American Secret Service outfit
that lives deep behind enemy lines

412
01:08:14,474 --> 01:08:16,016
will be your assist.

413
01:08:16,100 --> 01:08:19,978
The Germans call them the Basterds.

414
01:08:20,521 --> 01:08:23,732
The Basterds. Never heard of them.

415
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:26,735
Whole point of the Secret Service,
old boy, you not hearing of them.

416
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:30,822
But the Jerries have heard of them,
because these Yanks have been them the devil.

417
01:08:30,907 --> 01:08:35,619
You'll be dropped into France,
about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.

418
01:08:35,703 --> 01:08:37,788
The Basterds will be waiting for you.

419
01:08:37,872 --> 01:08:40,624
First thing, you'll go to a
little village called Nadine.

420
01:08:41,751 --> 01:08:44,544
In Nadine, there's a
tavern called La Louisiane.

421
01:08:44,629 --> 01:08:47,798
There you'll rendezvous with our
double agent. She'll take it from there.

422
01:08:47,882 --> 01:08:50,008
She's the one who is going
to get you into the premiere.

423
01:08:50,093 --> 01:08:53,845
It'll be you, her, and two
German-born members of the Basterds.

424
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:57,349
She's also made all the other
arrangements you're going to need.

425
01:08:58,184 --> 01:08:59,351
How will I know her?

426
01:08:59,477 --> 01:09:02,687
I suspect that won't be
too much trouble for you.

427
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:06,691
Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.

428
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,235
Bridget von Hammersmark?

429
01:09:09,487 --> 01:09:12,489
The German movie
star is working for England?

430
01:09:12,573 --> 01:09:15,158
Yes, for the last two years now.

431
01:09:15,243 --> 01:09:18,787
One could even say that
Operation Kino was her brainchild.

432
01:09:18,871 --> 01:09:20,038
Indeed.

433
01:09:20,123 --> 01:09:21,164
Got the gist?

434
01:09:21,249 --> 01:09:24,000
I think so, sir. Paris when it sizzles.

435
01:09:28,131 --> 01:09:31,633
You didn't say the goddamn
rendezvous is in a fucking basement.

436
01:09:31,717 --> 01:09:33,051
l didn't know.

437
01:09:33,136 --> 01:09:34,553
You said it was in a tavern.

438
01:09:34,637 --> 01:09:35,804
lt is a tavern.

439
01:09:35,888 --> 01:09:37,264
Yeah, in a basement.

440
01:09:37,932 --> 01:09:40,809
You know, fighting in a basement
offers a lot of difficulties.

441
01:09:40,893 --> 01:09:44,187
Number one being, you're
fighting in a basement.

442
01:09:44,272 --> 01:09:46,148
What if we go in there
and she's not even there?

443
01:09:46,232 --> 01:09:47,482
We wait.

444
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:52,404
Don't worry. She's a British
spy. She'll make the rendezvous.

445
01:10:13,926 --> 01:10:16,261
Stiglitz, right?

446
01:10:16,345 --> 01:10:17,387
That's right, sir.

447
01:10:18,639 --> 01:10:21,141
l hear you're pretty good with that.

448
01:10:24,937 --> 01:10:28,064
You know, we're not looking
for trouble right now.

449
01:10:28,316 --> 01:10:31,860
Simply making contact with our
agent. Should be uneventful.

450
01:10:33,696 --> 01:10:38,575
However, the off chance I'm
wrong, things prove eventful,

451
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:42,704
I need to know we can all remain calm.

452
01:10:47,418 --> 01:10:48,835
I don't look calm to you?

453
01:10:51,797 --> 01:10:56,676
Well, now that you put it
like that, l guess you do.

454
01:11:11,817 --> 01:11:17,614
This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not
exactly the loquacious type, is he?

455
01:11:19,450 --> 01:11:23,161
ls that the kind of man
you need? Loquacious type?

456
01:11:24,914 --> 01:11:27,457
Fair point, Lieutenant.

457
01:11:29,752 --> 01:11:32,504
So you all get in trouble in
there, what are we supposed to do?

458
01:11:32,588 --> 01:11:34,798
Make bets on how it all comes out?

459
01:11:36,008 --> 01:11:39,177
If we get into trouble,
we can handle it.

460
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:43,598
But if trouble does happen,
we need you to make damn sure

461
01:11:43,683 --> 01:11:47,852
no Germans, or French, for that
matter, escape from that basement.

462
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:53,024
If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is
compromised, the mission is kaput.

463
01:11:53,359 --> 01:11:59,030
Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose
idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?

464
01:12:00,032 --> 01:12:01,449
She chose the spot.

465
01:12:01,534 --> 01:12:03,159
Isn't that just dandy?

466
01:12:03,244 --> 01:12:07,205
Look, she's not a military
strategist. She's just an actress.

467
01:12:07,581 --> 01:12:11,418
You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to
know you don't want to fight in a basement.

468
01:12:11,502 --> 01:12:13,545
She wasn't picking a place to fight.

469
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:16,423
She was picking a place
isolated and without Germans.

470
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:24,652
Mmm.

471
01:31:45,884 --> 01:31:48,218
Well, if this is it, old boy,

472
01:31:48,803 --> 01:31:51,805
l hope you don't mind if I
go out speaking the King's.

473
01:31:52,932 --> 01:31:54,850
By all means, Captain.

474
01:32:00,899 --> 01:32:04,526
There's a special rung in hell reserved
for people who waste good Scotch.

475
01:32:05,945 --> 01:32:08,739
Seeing as I may be rapping
on the door momentarily,

476
01:32:13,828 --> 01:32:17,456
l must say, damn good stuff, sir.

477
01:32:20,752 --> 01:32:23,587
Now, about this pickle

478
01:32:25,173 --> 01:32:26,965
we find ourselves in.

479
01:32:29,385 --> 01:32:32,471
lt would appear there's only
one thing left for you to do.

480
01:32:32,555 --> 01:32:34,431
And what would that be?

481
01:32:35,141 --> 01:32:36,141
Stiglitz.

482
01:32:36,226 --> 01:32:37,643
Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.

483
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:16,139
You outside. Who are you?

484
01:33:16,724 --> 01:33:18,392
British? American?

485
01:33:19,143 --> 01:33:20,269
What?

486
01:33:21,062 --> 01:33:22,604
We're American.

487
01:33:22,897 --> 01:33:24,356
What are you?

488
01:33:24,691 --> 01:33:26,650
I'm a German, you idiot.

489
01:33:26,985 --> 01:33:29,695
Speak English
pretty good for a German.

490
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:30,988
l agree.

491
01:33:32,282 --> 01:33:33,782
So let's talk.

492
01:33:34,534 --> 01:33:35,909
Okay, talk.

493
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:38,078
I'm a father.

494
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:42,249
My baby was born today. ln Frankfurt.

495
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:44,293
Five hours ago.

496
01:33:44,919 --> 01:33:49,172
H is name is Max. We were in
here drinking, celebrating.

497
01:33:50,008 --> 01:33:53,427
They're the ones that came in shooting
and killing. It's not my fault!

498
01:33:53,511 --> 01:33:55,637
Okay! lt wasn't your fault.

499
01:33:57,015 --> 01:33:58,807
What's your name, soldier?

500
01:33:58,891 --> 01:34:00,142
Wilhelm.

501
01:34:01,019 --> 01:34:04,563
Now, is there anybody alive on our side?

502
01:34:04,647 --> 01:34:06,440
No. I'm alive!

503
01:34:08,651 --> 01:34:10,027
Who's that?

504
01:34:12,822 --> 01:34:14,823
ls the girl on your side?

505
01:34:16,367 --> 01:34:17,618
Which girl?

506
01:34:17,702 --> 01:34:20,120
Who do you think? Von Hammersmark.

507
01:34:21,706 --> 01:34:23,332
Yeah, she's ours.

508
01:34:24,167 --> 01:34:25,417
ls she okay?

509
01:34:28,421 --> 01:34:29,463
Wilhelm!

510
01:34:30,715 --> 01:34:32,341
She's been shot.

511
01:34:33,343 --> 01:34:34,926
But she's alive.

512
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,349
Okay, Wilhelm.

513
01:34:41,351 --> 01:34:43,769
What do you say we make us a deal?

514
01:34:45,104 --> 01:34:46,480
What's your name?

515
01:34:46,564 --> 01:34:47,689
Aldo.

516
01:34:48,566 --> 01:34:50,817
Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.

517
01:34:51,069 --> 01:34:54,696
You let me and one of my men come
down there and take the girl away.

518
01:34:54,781 --> 01:34:57,324
No guns. No guns me, no guns you.

519
01:34:57,408 --> 01:35:00,952
And we take the girl and
leave. It's that simple, Willi.

520
01:35:01,329 --> 01:35:03,789
You go your way, we go ours.

521
01:35:03,873 --> 01:35:06,750
And little Max gets to grow up
playing catch with his daddy.

522
01:35:07,919 --> 01:35:10,837
So what do you say,
Willi? We got us a deal?

523
01:35:15,259 --> 01:35:16,343
Aldo.

524
01:35:17,595 --> 01:35:19,221
I'm here, Willi.

525
01:35:20,848 --> 01:35:22,599
l want to trust you.

526
01:35:22,684 --> 01:35:23,850
But...

527
01:35:24,769 --> 01:35:26,269
But how can l?

528
01:35:28,481 --> 01:35:30,482
What choice you got, son?

529
01:35:36,364 --> 01:35:38,407
Okay, okay.

530
01:35:39,992 --> 01:35:41,201
Aldo,

531
01:35:42,286 --> 01:35:43,912
I'm going to trust you.

532
01:35:44,789 --> 01:35:45,789
Come down.

533
01:36:01,764 --> 01:36:04,725
Hey, Willi, what's with the machine
gun? l thought we had us a deal?

534
01:36:04,809 --> 01:36:07,060
We still have a deal.
Now, get the girl and go.

535
01:36:07,145 --> 01:36:08,687
Not so fast.

536
01:36:08,771 --> 01:36:11,356
We only got a deal,
we trust each other.

537
01:36:11,441 --> 01:36:13,150
And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.

538
01:36:13,651 --> 01:36:16,153
You need guns on me for it
to be a Mexican standoff.

539
01:36:16,821 --> 01:36:19,948
You got guns on us. You
decide to shoot, we're dead.

540
01:36:20,032 --> 01:36:23,326
Up top, they got grenades. They
drop them down here, you're dead.

541
01:36:23,411 --> 01:36:25,787
That's a Mexican standoff,
and that was not the deal.

542
01:36:25,872 --> 01:36:27,539
No trust, no deal.

543
01:36:43,431 --> 01:36:45,015
All right, Aldo.

544
01:36:46,684 --> 01:36:47,809
Fine.

545
01:36:51,189 --> 01:36:54,608
Just take that fucking traitor,
and get her out of my sight.

546
01:37:06,704 --> 01:37:10,123
Not so goddamn fast, doc. Tell
him to go play with his dogs.

547
01:37:22,303 --> 01:37:26,223
Before we yank that slug out you,
you need to answer a few questions.

548
01:37:26,307 --> 01:37:28,099
Few questions about what?

549
01:37:28,601 --> 01:37:30,769
About I got three men dead back there.

550
01:37:30,853 --> 01:37:33,647
Why don't you try telling
us what the fuck happened?

551
01:37:33,731 --> 01:37:37,692
The British officer blew his German
act and the Gestapo major saw it.

552
01:37:38,778 --> 01:37:41,029
Before we get into who shot John,

553
01:37:41,864 --> 01:37:45,992
why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous
in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?

554
01:37:50,915 --> 01:37:53,333
l can see since you didn't
see what happened inside,

555
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:56,086
that the Nazis being
there must look odd.

556
01:37:56,170 --> 01:37:58,672
Yeah, we got a word for
that kind of odd in English.

557
01:37:58,756 --> 01:38:00,757
It's called suspicious.

558
01:38:05,054 --> 01:38:06,847
Everybody needs to calm down.

559
01:38:06,931 --> 01:38:09,599
You're letting your imagination
get the better of you.

560
01:38:10,977 --> 01:38:13,937
You met the sergeant yourself. Willi.

561
01:38:14,021 --> 01:38:15,856
You remember him, don't you?

562
01:38:15,940 --> 01:38:16,940
Yeah, I remember him.

563
01:38:17,024 --> 01:38:20,777
His wife had a baby tonight.
He had just become a...

564
01:38:20,862 --> 01:38:22,571
He had just become a father!

565
01:38:22,655 --> 01:38:26,491
His commanding officer gave him and
his mates the night off to celebrate.

566
01:38:29,871 --> 01:38:36,126
The Germans being there was either a
trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.

567
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:37,961
It couldn't be both.

568
01:38:48,180 --> 01:38:50,056
How'd the shooting start?

569
01:38:50,141 --> 01:38:52,642
The Englishman gave himself away.

570
01:38:52,727 --> 01:38:54,352
How'd he do that?

571
01:38:55,605 --> 01:38:57,814
He ordered three glasses.

572
01:38:59,025 --> 01:39:00,942
We order three glasses.

573
01:39:01,152 --> 01:39:03,111
That's the German three.

574
01:39:03,988 --> 01:39:05,780
The other looks odd.

575
01:39:06,365 --> 01:39:08,700
Germans would and did notice it.

576
01:39:17,335 --> 01:39:19,419
Okay, let's pretend
there were no Germans

577
01:39:19,503 --> 01:39:22,088
and everything went exactly
the way it was supposed to.

578
01:39:22,173 --> 01:39:24,090
What was the next step?

579
01:39:24,342 --> 01:39:25,550
Tuxedos.

580
01:39:26,218 --> 01:39:28,970
To get them into the premiere
wearing military uniforms

581
01:39:29,055 --> 01:39:31,848
with all the military
there would've been suicide.

582
01:39:33,851 --> 01:39:37,103
But going as members of
the German film industry,

583
01:39:37,521 --> 01:39:40,690
they wear tuxedos and fit
in with everybody else.

584
01:39:42,193 --> 01:39:45,362
I arranged for the tailor
to fit three tuxedos tonight.

585
01:39:46,572 --> 01:39:48,990
How'd you intend to get
them in that premiere?

586
01:39:49,075 --> 01:39:50,700
Hand me my purse.

587
01:40:00,586 --> 01:40:03,004
Lieutenant Hicox was
going as my escort.

588
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:08,343
The other two were going as a
German cameraman and his assistant.

589
01:40:09,470 --> 01:40:11,137
You still get us in that premiere?

590
01:40:11,222 --> 01:40:14,391
You speak German better
than your friends? No.

591
01:40:14,809 --> 01:40:17,018
Have I been shot? Yes!

592
01:40:17,561 --> 01:40:22,399
I don't see me tripping the light
fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.

593
01:40:23,401 --> 01:40:25,819
Least of all, by tomorrow night.

594
01:40:38,708 --> 01:40:42,002
However, there's
something you don't know.

595
01:40:44,088 --> 01:40:48,174
There've been two recent
developments regarding Operation Kino.

596
01:40:49,969 --> 01:40:55,056
One, the venue has been changed
from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.

597
01:40:55,599 --> 01:40:58,768
Enormous change at the last
minute? That's not very Germatic.

598
01:40:58,853 --> 01:41:01,813
Why the hell is Goebbels
doing stuff so damn peculiar?

599
01:41:01,897 --> 01:41:05,608
It probably has something to
do with the second development.

600
01:41:05,985 --> 01:41:07,277
Which is?

601
01:41:11,574 --> 01:41:14,159
Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.

602
01:41:48,903 --> 01:41:50,528
Fuck a duck!

603
01:41:59,163 --> 01:42:01,039
What are you thinking?

604
01:42:02,333 --> 01:42:04,501
I'm thinking getting a whack
at planting old Uncle Adolf

605
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:06,461
makes this horse a different color.

606
01:42:06,545 --> 01:42:08,213
What is that supposed to mean?

607
01:42:08,297 --> 01:42:10,215
lt means you getting
us in that premiere.

608
01:42:10,299 --> 01:42:13,218
I'm probably going to
end up losing this leg.

609
01:42:13,844 --> 01:42:16,221
Bye-bye, acting career.
Fun while it lasted.

610
01:42:16,305 --> 01:42:19,182
How do you expect me
to walk the red carpet?

611
01:42:21,352 --> 01:42:24,354
Doggy doc's going to dig
that slug out your gam.

612
01:42:24,438 --> 01:42:26,481
He's going to wrap it up in a cast,

613
01:42:26,565 --> 01:42:28,691
and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg-
mountain-climbing story.

614
01:42:28,776 --> 01:42:31,444
That's German, ain't it? You all
like climbing mountains, don't you?

615
01:42:31,529 --> 01:42:34,823
I don't. I like smoking, drinking
and ordering in restaurants.

616
01:42:34,907 --> 01:42:36,699
But I see your point.

617
01:42:36,951 --> 01:42:40,453
We fill you up with morphine
till it's coming out your ears

618
01:42:40,538 --> 01:42:43,832
and just limp your little
ass up that reuge carpet.

619
01:42:45,334 --> 01:42:48,586
I know this is a silly
question before I ask it,

620
01:42:48,671 --> 01:42:54,050
but can you Americans speak
any other language than English?

621
01:42:54,885 --> 01:42:57,137
We both speak a little ltalian.

622
01:42:57,221 --> 01:42:59,722
With an atrocious accent, no doubt.

623
01:43:01,475 --> 01:43:04,936
But that doesn't exactly
kill us in the crib.

624
01:43:05,729 --> 01:43:08,565
Germans don't have a
good ear for ltalian.

625
01:43:12,486 --> 01:43:16,322
So you mumble ltalian and brazen
through it. Is that the plan?

626
01:43:16,574 --> 01:43:18,199
That's about it.

627
01:43:22,037 --> 01:43:23,037
That sounds good.

628
01:43:23,122 --> 01:43:25,498
It sounds like shit. What else
are we going to do? Go home?

629
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:27,417
No, that sounds good.

630
01:43:28,252 --> 01:43:32,172
If you don't blow it, with that,
I can get you in the building.

631
01:43:33,174 --> 01:43:34,215
Who does what?

632
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:38,469
Well, I speak the most ltalian,
so I'll be your escort.

633
01:43:38,554 --> 01:43:41,681
Donowitz speaks second most, so
he'll be your Italian cameraman.

634
01:43:41,765 --> 01:43:44,767
Omar, third most. He'll
be Donny's assistant.

635
01:43:45,311 --> 01:43:46,436
I don't speak ltalian.

636
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:49,898
Like I said, third best. Just
keep your fucking mouth shut.

637
01:43:49,982 --> 01:43:51,524
In fact, why don't you
start practicing right now?

638
01:47:20,901 --> 01:47:21,901
Yes.

639
01:53:51,166 --> 01:53:52,264
Gorlomi?

640
01:54:02,552 --> 01:54:04,432
Gorlomi.

641
01:54:12,938 --> 01:54:14,688
Gorlomi.

642
01:54:17,234 --> 01:54:19,068
Antonio Margheriti.

643
01:54:21,613 --> 01:54:23,329
Margheriti.

644
01:54:30,747 --> 01:54:32,081
Margheriti.

645
01:54:33,250 --> 01:54:34,250
Dominick Decocco.

646
01:54:34,376 --> 01:54:36,752
Dominick Decocco.

647
02:00:24,142 --> 02:00:25,934
What's that American expression?

648
02:00:26,019 --> 02:00:28,437
"If the shoe fits, you must wear it."

649
02:01:31,918 --> 02:01:36,505
Fucking shithead.
Faggot fuck. Fuck you!

650
02:01:36,631 --> 02:01:38,632
Bunch of shithead fuck.

651
02:01:41,552 --> 02:01:43,095
Fuck you, too!

652
02:01:45,723 --> 02:01:49,851
Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of
bitches! Get your hands off me.

653
02:01:50,353 --> 02:01:53,855
You fucking bratwurst-smelling...
Goddamn you! Get off!

654
02:01:59,362 --> 02:02:00,487
Hmm.

655
02:02:12,417 --> 02:02:13,750
You Jerry-banging,
Limburg-smelling...

656
02:02:18,006 --> 02:02:20,299
As Stanley said to Livingstone,

657
02:02:20,383 --> 02:02:22,551
Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?

658
02:02:23,469 --> 02:02:24,845
Hans Landa.

659
02:02:27,015 --> 02:02:29,391
You've had a nice long run, Aldo.

660
02:02:30,310 --> 02:02:33,145
Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.

661
02:02:33,229 --> 02:02:34,771
My hands to be exact.

662
02:02:34,856 --> 02:02:38,567
And they've been waiting
a long time to touch you.

663
02:02:42,447 --> 02:02:44,239
Caught you flinching.

664
02:02:48,453 --> 02:02:50,662
Touch me again, Kraut-burger.

665
02:03:06,512 --> 02:03:07,512
Utivich?

666
02:03:07,597 --> 02:03:09,014
Is that you, Lieutenant?

667
02:03:09,098 --> 02:03:10,182
Yeah.

668
02:03:10,767 --> 02:03:12,851
Do you know what happened to Donny?

669
02:03:12,935 --> 02:03:14,061
Omar?

670
02:03:14,771 --> 02:03:15,771
The woman?

671
02:03:15,855 --> 02:03:17,105
No, I do not.

672
02:04:03,653 --> 02:04:07,197
Tell me, Aldo, if I were
sitting where you're sitting,

673
02:04:07,281 --> 02:04:09,241
would you show me mercy?

674
02:04:13,830 --> 02:04:14,955
Nope.

675
02:04:15,623 --> 02:04:18,875
What is that English
expression about shoes and feet?

676
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:22,504
"Looks like the shoe is on the other
foot." Yeah, I was just thinking that.

677
02:04:35,560 --> 02:04:38,437
So you're Aldo the Apache.

678
02:04:39,564 --> 02:04:40,772
So you're The Jew Hunter.

679
02:04:40,857 --> 02:04:42,566
I'm a detective.

680
02:04:42,650 --> 02:04:44,526
A damn good detective.

681
02:04:44,861 --> 02:04:46,445
Finding people is my specialty,

682
02:04:46,529 --> 02:04:48,947
so naturally, I worked for
the Nazis finding people.

683
02:04:49,031 --> 02:04:52,159
And, yes, some of them
were Jews. But Jew Hunter?

684
02:04:53,494 --> 02:04:55,370
Just a name that stuck.

685
02:04:55,830 --> 02:04:58,623
Well, you do have to
admit, it is catchy.

686
02:05:00,084 --> 02:05:03,253
Do you control the nicknames
your enemies bestow on you?

687
02:05:03,337 --> 02:05:05,839
Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?

688
02:05:06,924 --> 02:05:09,050
What do you mean the Little Man?

689
02:05:09,135 --> 02:05:10,927
Germans' nickname for you.

690
02:05:11,012 --> 02:05:14,055
The Germans' nickname
for me is the Little Man?

691
02:05:14,432 --> 02:05:18,977
And as if to make my point, I'm a little
surprised how tall you were in real life.

692
02:05:19,061 --> 02:05:21,480
l mean, you're a little fellow,
but not circus-midget little,

693
02:05:21,564 --> 02:05:23,356
as your reputation would suggest.

694
02:05:23,441 --> 02:05:24,983
Where's my men?

695
02:05:25,526 --> 02:05:27,861
Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?

696
02:05:30,740 --> 02:05:33,909
Well, let's just say,
she got what she deserved.

697
02:05:36,412 --> 02:05:38,914
And when you purchase friends
like Bridget von Hammersmark,

698
02:05:38,998 --> 02:05:40,999
you get what you pay for.

699
02:05:42,418 --> 02:05:47,422
Now as far as your paesanos,
Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar...

700
02:05:47,507 --> 02:05:49,424
How you know our names?

701
02:05:50,009 --> 02:05:51,593
Lieutenant Aldo,

702
02:05:53,471 --> 02:05:54,888
if you don't think I
wouldn't interrogate

703
02:05:54,972 --> 02:05:58,350
every single one of your
swastika-marked survivors,

704
02:06:00,770 --> 02:06:04,356
we simply aren't operating on the
level of mutual respect I assumed.

705
02:06:04,440 --> 02:06:06,024
No, I guess not.

706
02:06:06,234 --> 02:06:11,363
Well, back to the whereabouts
of your two ltalian saboteurs.

707
02:06:14,534 --> 02:06:16,284
As of this moment,

708
02:06:16,369 --> 02:06:21,206
both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting
in the very seats we left them in.

709
02:06:21,832 --> 02:06:25,460
Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24,
if my memory serves.

710
02:06:26,212 --> 02:06:29,631
Explosives still around their
ankles, still ready to explode.

711
02:06:29,715 --> 02:06:32,968
And your mission, some
would call a terrorist plot,

712
02:06:33,052 --> 02:06:35,554
as of this moment, is still a go.

713
02:06:35,638 --> 02:06:38,974
That's a pretty exciting story.
What's next? Eliza on lce?

714
02:06:39,058 --> 02:06:40,308
However,

715
02:06:42,186 --> 02:06:45,313
all I have to do is pick
up this phone right here,

716
02:06:45,398 --> 02:06:48,233
inform the cinema,
and your plan is kaput.

717
02:06:50,653 --> 02:06:55,865
If they're still here, and if they're
still alive, and that's one big if,

718
02:06:57,201 --> 02:06:58,994
there ain't no way you're
going to take them boys

719
02:06:59,078 --> 02:07:00,704
without setting off them bombs.

720
02:07:00,788 --> 02:07:02,539
I have no doubt.

721
02:07:02,623 --> 02:07:05,917
And, yes, some Germans will die.
Yes, it will ruin the evening.

722
02:07:06,002 --> 02:07:08,920
And, yes, Goebbels will be
very, very, very mad at you

723
02:07:09,005 --> 02:07:11,089
for what you've done to his big night.

724
02:07:12,341 --> 02:07:14,634
But you won't get Hitler,
you won't get Goebbels,

725
02:07:14,719 --> 02:07:17,762
you won't get Goring,
and you won't get Bormann.

726
02:07:17,847 --> 02:07:20,432
And you need all four to end the war.

727
02:07:22,101 --> 02:07:25,270
But if I don't pick up
this phone right here,

728
02:07:25,354 --> 02:07:27,689
you may very well get all four.

729
02:07:28,941 --> 02:07:33,778
And if you get all four, you end the war

730
02:07:35,031 --> 02:07:36,281
tonight.

731
02:07:37,658 --> 02:07:39,200
So, gentlemen,

732
02:07:39,910 --> 02:07:43,121
let's discuss the prospect
of ending the war tonight.

733
02:07:46,042 --> 02:07:47,876
So, the way I see it,

734
02:07:47,960 --> 02:07:52,172
since Hitler's death or possible
rescue rests solely on my reaction,

735
02:07:52,840 --> 02:07:54,424
if I do nothing,

736
02:07:54,842 --> 02:07:57,552
it's as if I'm causing his
death even more than yourselves.

737
02:07:57,637 --> 02:07:58,887
Wouldn't you agree?

738
02:07:59,555 --> 02:08:00,889
I guess so.

739
02:08:03,476 --> 02:08:05,477
How about you, Utivich?

740
02:08:05,561 --> 02:08:07,187
I guess so, too.

741
02:08:12,735 --> 02:08:13,985
Gentlemen, l have no intention

742
02:08:14,070 --> 02:08:17,155
of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels
and killing Goring and killing Bormann,

743
02:08:17,239 --> 02:08:19,991
not to mention winning the war
single-handedly for the Allies,

744
02:08:20,076 --> 02:08:23,828
only later to find myself
standing before a Jewish tribunal.

745
02:08:25,915 --> 02:08:29,459
If you want to win the war tonight,

746
02:08:31,087 --> 02:08:33,254
we have to make a deal.

747
02:08:36,258 --> 02:08:38,009
What kind of deal?

748
02:08:38,094 --> 02:08:40,637
The kind you wouldn't
have the authority to make.

749
02:08:40,721 --> 02:08:45,266
However, I'm sure this mission
of yours has a commanding officer.

750
02:08:46,268 --> 02:08:47,602
A general.

751
02:08:48,270 --> 02:08:49,938
I'm betting for...

752
02:08:51,649 --> 02:08:53,566
OSS would be my guess.

753
02:08:57,488 --> 02:08:59,948
That's a bingo!

754
02:09:02,952 --> 02:09:05,453
Is that the way you say
it? "That's a bingo."

755
02:09:05,538 --> 02:09:07,414
You just say, "Bingo."

756
02:09:07,498 --> 02:09:09,749
Bingo! How fun.

757
02:09:12,169 --> 02:09:15,255
But I digress. Where were
we? Yeah! Make a deal.

758
02:09:15,798 --> 02:09:20,218
Over there is a very capable
two-way radio and sitting behind it

759
02:09:20,302 --> 02:09:24,472
is a more than capable
radio operator named Hermann.

760
02:09:24,807 --> 02:09:27,142
Get me someone on the
other end of that radio

761
02:09:27,226 --> 02:09:30,270
with the power of the
pen to authorize my,

762
02:09:30,354 --> 02:09:33,273
let's call it, the terms
of my conditional surrender.

763
02:09:33,357 --> 02:09:35,775
If that tastes better going down.

764
02:09:36,569 --> 02:09:37,819
You know, where I'm from...

765
02:09:37,903 --> 02:09:39,779
Yeah? Where is that exactly?

766
02:09:39,864 --> 02:09:41,906
Maynardville, Tennessee.

767
02:09:41,991 --> 02:09:44,451
I've done my share of bootlegging.

768
02:09:44,660 --> 02:09:48,329
Up there, if you engage in what the
federal government calls illegal activity,

769
02:09:48,414 --> 02:09:50,540
but what we call just a man trying
to make a living for his family

770
02:09:50,624 --> 02:09:55,044
selling moonshine liquor, it
behooves oneself to keep his wits.

771
02:09:57,006 --> 02:10:00,425
Long story short, we hear
a story too good to be true,

772
02:10:01,093 --> 02:10:02,343
it ain't.

773
02:10:04,180 --> 02:10:06,931
Sitting in your chair, l would
probably say the same thing,

774
02:10:07,016 --> 02:10:11,728
and 999.999 times out of a
million, you would be correct.

775
02:10:13,731 --> 02:10:17,317
But in the pages of history,
every once in a while,

776
02:10:17,902 --> 02:10:21,279
fate reaches out and extends its hand.

777
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:30,079
What shall the history books read?

778
02:10:56,941 --> 02:11:00,151
I implore you. We
must destroy that tower.

779
02:11:01,570 --> 02:11:03,196
Sarge, that tower...

780
02:11:22,758 --> 02:11:24,676
The tower stands!

781
02:11:31,809 --> 02:11:34,310
Psst! Psst!

782
02:14:04,420 --> 02:14:06,587
So when the military
history of this night is written,

783
02:14:06,672 --> 02:14:10,341
it will be recorded that I
was part of Operation Kino

784
02:14:10,426 --> 02:14:13,219
from the very beginning
as a double agent.

785
02:14:13,303 --> 02:14:17,348
Anything I've done in
my guise as an SS Colonel

786
02:14:17,433 --> 02:14:20,476
was sanctioned by the
OSS as a necessary evil

787
02:14:20,561 --> 02:14:23,271
to establish my cover with the Germans.

788
02:14:23,480 --> 02:14:26,774
And it was my placement of
Lieutenant Raine's dynamite

789
02:14:26,859 --> 02:14:29,819
in Hitler and Goebbels' opera
box that assured their demise.

790
02:14:46,962 --> 02:14:49,964
By the way, that last
part is actually true.

791
02:14:50,049 --> 02:14:54,969
I want my full military pension
and benefits under my proper rank.

792
02:14:55,304 --> 02:14:57,722
I want to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor

793
02:14:57,806 --> 02:15:01,768
for my invaluable assistance in
the toppling of the Third Reich.

794
02:15:03,187 --> 02:15:06,272
In fact, I want all the
members of Operation Kino

795
02:15:06,356 --> 02:15:09,317
to receive the
Congressional Medal of Honor.

796
02:15:09,693 --> 02:15:13,404
Full citizenship for myself.
Well, that goes without saying.

797
02:15:13,697 --> 02:15:16,908
And I would like the
United States of America

798
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:21,079
to purchase property for
me on Nantucket lsland

799
02:15:21,163 --> 02:15:24,415
as a reward for all the
countless lives I've saved

800
02:15:24,500 --> 02:15:26,834
by bringing the tyranny of
the National Socialist Party

801
02:15:26,919 --> 02:15:30,546
to a swifter-than-imagined end.
Do you have all that, sir?

802
02:15:32,341 --> 02:15:35,802
l look forward to seeing you
face to face as well, sir.

803
02:15:36,678 --> 02:15:38,888
Lieutenant Raine? Right here.

804
02:15:42,101 --> 02:15:43,309
Yes, sir.

805
02:15:43,393 --> 02:15:47,146
Colonel Landa will put you and
Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.

806
02:15:47,231 --> 02:15:51,609
Then he and his radio operator will
get in the truck and drive to our lines.

807
02:15:51,693 --> 02:15:56,280
Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa
and his man will surrender to you.

808
02:15:56,365 --> 02:15:58,908
You will then take over
driving of the truck

809
02:15:58,992 --> 02:16:02,370
and bring them straight to me for
debriefing. ls that clear, Lieutenant?

810
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:03,579
Yes, sir.

811
02:16:03,664 --> 02:16:05,123
Over and out.

812
02:21:49,301 --> 02:21:51,886
When I kill that guy, you got
30 feet to get to that guard.

813
02:21:51,970 --> 02:21:53,929
Can you do it? I have to.

814
02:22:24,169 --> 02:22:25,503
Champagne?

815
02:23:17,347 --> 02:23:20,057
Who wants to send a message to Germany?

816
02:23:20,892 --> 02:23:23,227
I have a message for Germany.

817
02:23:26,690 --> 02:23:28,941
That you are all going to die.

818
02:23:32,696 --> 02:23:38,117
And I want you to look deep into the
face of the Jew who's going to do it!

819
02:23:40,203 --> 02:23:43,289
Marcel, burn it down.

820
02:23:44,291 --> 02:23:45,791
Oui, Shosanna.

821
02:24:21,244 --> 02:24:23,370
My name is Shosanna Dreyfus,

822
02:24:23,747 --> 02:24:25,331
and this is the face

823
02:24:27,292 --> 02:24:29,627
of Jewish vengeance.

824
02:26:35,295 --> 02:26:37,087
Hermann, uncuff them.

825
02:26:55,732 --> 02:26:59,735
I'm officially surrendering myself
over to you, Lieutenant Raine.

826
02:27:00,862 --> 02:27:02,654
We're your prisoners.

827
02:27:03,490 --> 02:27:05,199
How about my knife?

828
02:27:11,164 --> 02:27:13,123
Thank you very much, Colonel.

829
02:27:13,208 --> 02:27:16,293
Utivich, cuff the Colonel's
hands behind his back.

830
02:27:16,377 --> 02:27:18,587
ls that really necessary?

831
02:27:18,671 --> 02:27:20,756
I'm a slave to appearances.

832
02:27:23,927 --> 02:27:25,427
Scalp Hermann.

833
02:27:27,096 --> 02:27:28,764
Are you mad?

834
02:27:29,140 --> 02:27:30,891
What have you done?

835
02:27:31,392 --> 02:27:34,728
I made a deal with your
general for that man's life!

836
02:27:35,814 --> 02:27:39,191
Yeah, they made that deal. But they
don't give a fuck about him. They need you.

837
02:27:39,275 --> 02:27:41,235
You'll be shot for this!

838
02:27:41,903 --> 02:27:45,405
Nah, I don't think so. More like
chewed out. I've been chewed out before.

839
02:27:46,741 --> 02:27:50,911
You know, Utivich and myself heard
that deal you made with the brass.

840
02:27:51,371 --> 02:27:53,121
End the war tonight?

841
02:27:54,541 --> 02:27:56,083
I'd make that deal.

842
02:27:56,167 --> 02:27:58,001
How about you, Utivich?
You make that deal?

843
02:27:58,086 --> 02:27:59,086
I'd make that deal.

844
02:27:59,170 --> 02:28:01,672
I don't blame you. Damn good deal.

845
02:28:02,423 --> 02:28:05,551
And that pretty little nest
you feathered for yourself.

846
02:28:05,635 --> 02:28:09,012
Well, if you're willing to
barbecue the whole High Command,

847
02:28:09,097 --> 02:28:12,099
l suppose that's worth
certain considerations.

848
02:28:12,851 --> 02:28:14,935
But I do have one question.

849
02:28:16,020 --> 02:28:18,772
When you get to your little
place on Nantucket lsland,

850
02:28:18,857 --> 02:28:23,402
l imagine you are going to take off that
handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.

851
02:28:23,486 --> 02:28:24,820
Ain't you?

852
02:28:28,783 --> 02:28:30,659
That's what I thought.

853
02:28:31,411 --> 02:28:33,287
Now, that I can't abide.

854
02:28:34,706 --> 02:28:36,999
How about you, Utivich,
can you abide it?

855
02:28:37,083 --> 02:28:38,959
Not one damn bit, sir.

856
02:28:40,587 --> 02:28:42,671
l mean, if I had my way,

857
02:28:43,172 --> 02:28:47,634
you'd wear that goddamn uniform for
the rest of your pecker-sucking life.

858
02:28:49,137 --> 02:28:50,137
But I'm aware that ain't practical.

859
02:28:50,221 --> 02:28:53,265
I mean, at some point, you're
going to have to take it off.

860
02:28:53,349 --> 02:28:54,474
So,

861
02:28:55,435 --> 02:28:59,146
I'm going to give you a little
something you can't take off.

862
02:29:24,088 --> 02:29:26,214
You know something, Utivich?

863
02:29:26,591 --> 02:29:29,384
I think this just
might be my masterpiece.
