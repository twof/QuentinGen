Whoa.
 Whoa.
 Who's that stumblin' around in the dark?
 State your business or prepare to get winged!
 Calm yourselves, gentlemen.
 I mean you no harm.
 I'm simply a fellow weary traveler.
 Whoa, boy.
 Good cold evening, gentlemen.
 I'm looking for a pair of slave traders that go by the name of the Speck Brothers.
 Might that be you?
 - Who wants to know?
 - Well, I do.
 I'm Dr.
 King Schultz.
 This is my horse, Fritz.
 - What kinda doctor?
 - Dentist.
 Now, are you the Speck Brothers?
 And did you purchase those men at the Greenville slave auction?
 - So what?
 - So I wish to parley with you.
 - Speak English.
 - Oh, I'm sorry.
 Please forgive me.
 It is a second language.
 Now, amongst your inventory, I've been led to believe, is a specimen I'm keen to acquire.
 Hello, you poor devils!
 Is there one amongst you who was formerly a resident of the Carrucan plantation?
 I'm from the Carrucan plantation.
 Who said that?
 What's your name?
 Django.
 Then you are exactly the one I'm looking for.
 Do you know who the Brittle Brothers are?
 Who are they?
 Big John.
 Ellis.
 Roger.
 Sometime they call him Lil Raj.
 They was overseers at the Carrucan plantation.
 Not anymore.
 Tell me if you were to see any of these three gentlemen again, - would you recognize them?
 - Hey.
 - Stop talkin' to him like that.
 - Like What?
 Like that.
 My good man, I'm simply trying to ascertain Speak English, goddamn it.
 Everybody calm down.
 I'm simply a customer trying to conduct a transaction.
 I don't care.
 No sale.
 Now, off with ya.
 Don't be ridiculous.
 Of course they're for sale.
 Move it.
 My good man, did you simply get carried away with your dramatic gesture or are you pointing your weapon at me with lethal intention?
 Last chance, fancy pants.
 Oh, very well.
 I'm sorry to put a bullet in your beast, but I didn't want you to do anything rash before you had a moment to come to your senses.
 You goddamn son of a bitch!
 - You shot Roscoe!
 - Well And you killed Ace!
 I only shot your brother once he threatened to shoot me.
 And I do believe I have one, two, three, four five witnesses who can attest to that fact.
 - Damn leg's busted!
 - No doubt.
 Now, if you could keep your caterwauling down to a minimum, I'd like to finish my line of inquiry with young Django.
 - God-fuckin'-damn it!
 - As I was saying if you were to see the Brittle Brothers again, you could recognize 'em?
 Yeah.
 Sold American!
 So, Mr.
 Speck?
 Mr.
 Speck?
 How much for young Django here?
 That iron is nasty business.
 Oh, could you hold this for a moment?
 Thank you.
 Django?
 Get up on that horse.
 Also, if I were you, I'd take that winter coat the dear departed Speck left behind.
 Nigger!
 Don't you touch my brother's coat.
 Goddamn it!
 Oh!
 One hundred ten 20 and five for young Django here.
 And since he won't be needing it anymore, I'd like to purchase your brother's nag.
 Also, Mr.
 Speck, I'm afraid I will require a bill of sale.
 Do you have one?
 You go to hell, dentist.
 I thought not.
 No worries.
 I come prepared.
 Thank you.
 This will serve nicely as a bill of sale.
 Whoa.
 Now, as to you poor devils.
 So, as I see it, when it comes to the subject of what to do next, you gentlemen have two choices.
 Once I'm gone, you could lift that beast off the remaining Speck, then carry him to the nearest town.
 Which would be at least 37 miles back the way you came.
 You could unshackle yourselves, take that rifle, put a bullet in his head, bury the two of them deep, and then make your way to a more enlightened area of this country.
 Choice is yours.
 Oh, and on the off chance there are any astronomy aficionados amongst you, the North Star is that one.
 Ta-ta.
 Now wait a minute, fellas.
 Let's talk about this!
 You gotta be reasonable in a situation like this!
 I'm not a bad guy.
 I'm just doin' my job!
 Blueberry, didn't I give you my last apple?
 Tell you what, boys: Take me to the doc in El Paso, I'll get you your freedom.
 No.
 No, please All right, now.
 I'd like you to take two of these tonight and then in the morning That's a nigger on a horse.
 What's everybody staring at?
 They ain't never seen no nigger on a horse before.
 Whoa.
 Good morning, innkeeper!
 Two beers for two weary travelers.
 It's still a bit early.
 We won't be open for another hour.
 By then, we'll be servin' breakfast.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa what the hell you think you're doing, boy?
 Get that nigger outta here!
 - Help!
 Help!
 - Innkeeper!
 Remember, get the sheriff, not the marshal.
 Sheriff!
 Help!
 Alas.
 Now we must act as our own bartender.
 Sit down, my boy.
 What kind of dentist are you?
 Despite that cart, I haven't practiced dentistry in five years.
 But these days, I practice a new profession bounty hunter.
 Do you know what a bounty hunter is?
 No.
 Well the way the slave trade deals in human lives for cash, a bounty hunter deals in corpses.
 Hat Prost.
 The state places a bounty on a man's head.
 I track that man, I find that man, I kill that man.
 After I've killed him, I transport that man's corpse back to the authorities.
 Sometimes that's easier said than done.
 I show that corpse to the authorities, proving yes, indeed, I truly have killed him, at which point the authorities pay me the bounty.
 So, like slavery, it's a flesh for cash business.
 What's a bounty?
 It's like a reward.
 You kill people?
 And they give you a reward?
 Certain people, yeah.
 Bad people?
 Ah!
 Badder they are, bigger the reward.
 Which brings me to you.
 And I must admit, I'm at a bit of a quandary when it comes to you.
 On one hand, I despise slavery.
 On the other hand, I need your help.
 If you're not in a position to refuse, all the better.
 So, for the time being, I'm gonna make this slavery malarkey work to my benefit.
 Still, having said that, I feel guilty.
 So, I would like the two of us to enter into an agreement.
 I'm looking for the Brittle Brothers.
 However, at this endeavor, I'm at a slight disadvantage insofar as I don't know what they look like.
 But you do.
 Don't ya?
 I know what they look like all right.
 Good.
 So here's my agreement.
 - You travel with me until we find them.
 - Where we goin'?
 I hear at least two of them are overseeing up in Gatlinburg, but I don't know where.
 That means we visit every plantation in Gatlinburg till we find 'em.
 And when we find them, you point them out, and I kill them.
 You do that, I agree to give you your freedom, $25 per Brittle Brother.
 That's $75.
 And, as if on cue, here comes the sheriff.
 OK, boys.
 Fun's over.
 Come on out.
 All right, folks, calm down.
 Go about your business.
 These jokers will be gone soon.
 Now, why y'all wanna come into my town and start trouble?
 And scare all these nice people.
 You ain't got nothing better to do than to come into Bill Sharp's town and show your ass?
 What'd you just do to our sheriff?
 Now you can get the marshal.
 Marshal!
 Marshal!
 - Should we wait inside?
 - Can we just leave?
 After you.
 Move that buckboard a long ways across the street from the saloon.
 I want six men, six rifles behind it.
 I want two men, two rifles up on this roof.
 Two men, two rifles on that roof.
 All the barrels aimed at that front door.
 Somebody get poor Bill outta the goddamn street.
 You in the saloon!
 We got a hundred rifles aimed at every way out of that buildin'.
 You got one chance to get out of this alive.
 You and your nigger come out right now with your hands over your head, and I mean right now.
 Is this the marshal I have the pleasure of addressing?
 Yes, it is.
 This is U.
S.
 Marshal Gill Tatum.
 Na wunderbar, marshal.
 I have relieved myself of all weapons, and just as you have instructed, I am ready to step outside with my hands raised above my head.
 I trust as a representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America, I shan't be shot down in the street by either you or your deputies before I've had my day in court.
 You mean like you did our sheriff.
 Shot him down like a dog in the street.
 Yes, that's exactly what I mean.
 Do I have your word as a lawman not to shoot me down like a dog in the street?
 Well, much as we'd all enjoy seeing something like that, ain't nobody gonna cheat the hangman in my town.
 Fair enough, marshal.
 Here we come.
 They're a little tense out there.
 So don't make any quick movements, and let me do the talking.
 Come ahead.
 You unarmed?
 Yes, indeed we are.
 Marshal Tatum, may I address you and your deputies, and apparently the entire town of Daughtrey, as to the incident that just occurred?
 - Go on.
 - Thank you.
 My name is Dr.
 King Schultz.
 Like yourself, marshal, I'm a servant of the court.
 The man lying dead in the dirt, who the good people of Daughtrey saw fit to elect as their sheriff, who went by the name of Bill Sharp, is actually a wanted outlaw by the name of Willard Peck, with a price on his head of $200.
 Now that's $200, dead or alive.
 The hell, you say!
 I'm aware this is probably disconcerting news.
 But I'm willing to wager this man was elected sheriff sometime in the past two years?
 Yeah.
 I know this because three years ago, he was rustling cattle from the B.
C.
 Corrigan Cattle Company of Lubbock, Texas.
 Now, this is a warrant made out by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas.
 You're encouraged to wire him.
 He'll back up who I am and who your dear departed sheriff was.
 In other words, marshal, you owe me $200.
 I'll be damned.
 After this Brittle business is behind us, you'll be a free man, with a horse, $75 in your back pocket What's your plan after that?
 Find my wife, and buy her freedom.
 Django, I had no idea you were a married man.
 Do most slaves believe in marriage?
 Oh, me and my wife do.
 Old Man Carrucan didn't.
 That's why we, uh we run off.
 Django.
 Django, Django- You got sand, Django.
 Boy's got sand.
 I got no use for a nigger with sand.
 I want you to burn a runaway
"r
" right here on his cheek.
 And the girl, too.
 And I want you to take 'em to the Greenville auction and sell 'em.
 Both of 'em.
 Separately.
 And this one you will sell him cheap.
 In Greenville there should be some sort of a records office.
 You know when she was sold you know where she came from, and you know her name.
 What is her name?
 Broomhilda.
 - What?
 - Broom-hilda.
 - Broomhilda?
 - Hm-mm.
 - Were her owners German?
 - Yeah, how you know?
 She wasn't born on the Carrucan plantation.
 She was raised by a German mistress, the Von Shafts.
 She speak a little German, too.
 - Your wife?
 - Hm-mm.
 When she was little, her mistress taught her so she'd have somebody to speak German with.
 Well, let me get this straight.
 Your slave wife speaks German and her name is Broomhilda Von Shaft?
 Yep.
 They call me Hildi.
 When we gain access to these plantations, we'll be putting on an act.
 You'll be playing a character.
 Hm?
 No?
 During the act, you can never break character.
 Do you understand?
 Yeah.
 Don't break character.
 And your character is that of The Valet.
 What that is?
 That's a fancy word for servant.
 - Valet?
 - Hm-mm.
 And now, Django, you may choose your character's costume.
 Youse gonna let me pick out my own clothes?
 But of course.
 Whoa.
 It's against the law for niggers to ride horses in this territory.
 This is my valet.
 My valet does not walk.
 - I said niggers on horses - His name is Django.
 He's a free man.
 He can ride what he pleases.
 Not on my property.
 Not around my niggers, he can't.
 My good sir, perhaps we got off on the wrong boot.
 Allow me to unring this bell.
 My name is Dr.
 King Schultz.
 This is my valet, Django.
 And these are our horses, Tony and Fritz.
 Mr.
 Bennett?
 I've been led to believe that you are a gentleman and a businessman.
 And it is for these attributes we've ridden from Texas to Tennessee to parley with you now.
 I wish to purchase one of your nigger gals.
 You and your Jimmie rode from Texas to Tennessee to buy one of my nigger gals?
 No appointment, no nothin'?
 Oh, I'm afraid so.
 Well, what if I was to say I don't like you?
 Or your fancy-pants nigger?
 And I wouldn't sell you a tinker's damn.
 Now what you got to say about that?
 Mr.
 Bennett.
 If you are the businessman I've been led to believe you to be, I have 5,000 things I might say that could change your mind.
 Well, come on inside and get yourself somethin' cool to drink.
 Hm-mm.
 Oh, maybe while we discuss business, you could provide one of your loveliest black creatures to escort Django here around your magnificent grounds.
 Oh, well, absolutely!
 Uh, Betina.
 - Yessir, Big Daddy?
 - Uh What's your Jimmie's name again?
 'Django.
 'Django.
 Betina, sugar, could you take Django there and take him around the grounds here and show him all the pretty stuff.
 As you please, Big Daddy.
 Oh, Mr.
 Bennett, I must remind you, Django is a free man.
 He cannot be treated like a slave.
 He within the bounds of good taste, he must be treated as an extension of myself.
 - Understood, Schultz.
 Betina, sugar?
 - Yes'm?
 Django isn't a slave.
 Django is a free man, you understand?
 You can't treat him like any of the other niggers around here, 'cause he ain't like any of the other niggers around here.
 You got it?
 You want I should treat him like white folks?
 No.
 That's not what I said.
 Then I don't know what you want, Big Daddy.
 Yes, I can see that.
 Uh What's the name of that peckerwood boy from town that works with the glass?
 His mama work over at the lumberyard.
 - Oh, you mean Jerry.
 - That's the boy's name.
 Jerry!
 You know Jerry, don't you, sugar?
 - Yes'm, Big Daddy.
 - Well, that's it, then.
 You just treat him like you would Jerry.
 That house we just left from is The Big House.
 Big Daddy call it that 'cause it's big.
 That there is the pantry.
 That's where Big Daddy hang all his dead meat.
 Po' little squirrels.
 What you do for your massa?
 Didn't you hear him tell you I ain't no slave?
 - So you really free?
 - Yes, I's free.
 You mean you wanna dress like that?
 - Betina, I need to ask you somethin'.
 - What you want?
 I'm lookin' for three white men.
 Three brothers.
 Overseers.
 Their name is Brittle.
 You know 'em?
 - Brittle?
 - Yes, Brittle.
 John Brittle, Ellis Brittle, Roger Brittle, sometime called Lil Raj.
 I don't know them.
 They could be usin' a different name.
 They woulda come to the plantation this past year.
 - You mean the Shaffers?
 - Maybe.
 - Three brothers?
 - Uh-huh.
 - They here?
 - Uh-huh.
 Could you point one of 'em out to me?
 Well, one's over in that field.
 Old Man Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this, now.
 She work in the house, John.
 You could mess her skin up, and you gonna mess her up and she ain't gonna be worth she ain't gonna be worth a damn thing.
 Now, your Bible say Look, I told you that I was one that made her do it.
 You ready?
 She didn't wanna run off with me.
 If anybody should be gettin' whupped now, it should be me.
 It should be me, John.
 Now, I been here long enough, you know me, you know me a long time, now.
 You know Massa Carrucan ain't gonna appreciate this.
 She's a she's a house slave.
 She a house slave, she can't be On my knees.
 I'm asking you this, please.
 Ain't this what you want?
 I'm keeping it funny for you.
 Now, John, please.
 L's on my knees, John.
 I like the way you beg, boy.
 Is that who you was lookin' for?
 Yep.
 Where the other two at?
 They by the stable, punishin' Little Jody for breakin' eggs.
 They whippin' Little Jody?
 Point me in that direction.
 You go to that tree and keep goin' that-a way.
 Go get that white man I came here with.
 - Come on, now.
 - No, no, please!
 - Come on, girlie.
 - Please!
 Come on.
 Get you set up now.

"And the Lord said, 'The fear of ye
"
"and the dread of ye shall be on every beast of the earth.

"' Come here now, woman!
 You'd better give me that arm!
 OK, she's ready!
 And after this, we'll see if you break eggs again.
 John Brittle!
 You remember me?
 I like the way you die, boy.
 Goddamn son of a bitch!
 Keep it funny!
 Y'all wanna see somethin'?
 No!
 Who were they?
 That's Big John, and that's Lil Raj.
 Where's Ellis?
 He's the one hightailin' it across that field right now.
 - You sure that's him?
 - Yeah.
 - Positive?
 - I don't know.
 - You don't know if you're positive?
 - I don't know what
"positive
" mean.
 - It means you're sure.
 - Yes.
 -
"Yes,
" what?
 - Yes, I'm sure that's Ellis Brittle.
 I'm positive he dead.
 Django!
 Everybody calm down.
 We mean no one else any harm.
 Who are you two jokers?
 I am Dr.
 King Schultz, a legal representative of the criminal justice system of the United States of America.
 The man to my left is Django Freeman.
 He's my deputy.
 In my pocket is a warrant, signed by Circuit Court Judge Henry Allen Laudermilk of Austin, Texas, for the arrest and capture, dead or alive, of John Brittle, Roger Brittle and Ellis Brittle.
 They were goin' by the name Shaffer.
 You know them by the name of Shaffer, but the butchers' real name was Brittle.
 These are wanted men.
 The law wants 'em for murder.
 Now, I reiterate, the warrant states dead or alive, so when Mr.
 Freeman and myself executed these men on sight, we were operating within our legal boundaries.
 I realize passions are high, but I must warn you, the penalty for taking deadly force against an officer of the court in the performance of his duty is you'll be hung by the neck until you're dead.
 Now, may I please remove the warrant from my pocket so you may examine it?
 Gimme.
 Satisfied?
 May I have that back, please?
 - Get off my land.
 - Posthaste.
 Load up the bodies as quickly as you can and let's get outta here.
 Yeah, that's them sons-a-bitches.
 Come on, men!
 - We're coming for you, nigger!
 - Hee-haw!
 Now, unless they start shootin' first, nobody shoot 'em.
 That's way too simple for these jokers.
 We're gonna whup that nigger-lover to death.
 And I'm gonna personally strip and clip that garboon myself.
 Damn.
 I can't see fuckin' shit outta this thing.
 We ready or what?
 Aw, hold on, I'm fuckin' with my eyeholes.
 Oh Oh, shit.
 I just made it worse.
 Who made this goddamn shit?
 - Willard's wife.
 - Well, make your own goddamn masks!
 Look, nobody's sayin' they don't appreciate what Jenny did.
 Well, if all I had to do was cut a hole in a bag, I coulda cut it better than this!
 What about you, Robert?
 Can you see?
 Not too good.
 I mean, if I don't move my head I can see you pretty good, more or less.
 But when I start ridin', the bag's movin' all over, and I'm ridin' blind.
 - Shit.
 - Yeah.
 I just made mine worse.
 Oh, God.
 Anybody bring any extra bags?
 No, nobody brought an extra bag!
 I'm just askin'.
 Do we have to wear 'em when we ride?
 Oh, well, shitfire!
 If you don't wear 'em as you ride up, that just defeats the purpose!
 Well, I can't see in this fuckin' thing!
 I can't breathe in this fuckin' thing and I can't ride in this fuckin' thing!
 Well, fuck all y'all!
 I'm goin' home!
 Now, I watched my wife work all day gettin' 30 bags together for you ungrateful sons-a-bitches, and all I can hear is criticize, criticize, criticize!
 From now on, don't ask me or mine for nothin'!
 Now, look, let's not forget why we're here.
 We got a killer nigger over that hill there!
 And we gotta make a lesson out of him.
 OK, I'm confused.
 Are the bags on or off?
 I think we all think the bag was a nice idea.
 Yeah.
 But, not pointin' any fingers, they coulda been done better.
 So how 'bout no bags this time, but next time we do the bags right and then we go full regalia.
 - I like that idea a lot.
 - You get my vote, Robert.
 Wait a minute!
 I didn't say no bags.
 But nobody can see.
 So?
 So it'd be nice to see.
 Goddamn it!
 This is a raid!
 I can't see, you can't see!
 So what?
 All that matters is can the fuckin' horse see!
 That's a raid!
 Sons of bitches!
 I can't see shit!
 There he is!
 Get that nigger out from under that wagon!
 And get that nigger-lover outta the wagon!
 That nigger ain't down here, Big Daddy!
 - What?
 - They tricked us!
 Well, where are they?
 Auf Wiedersehen.
 Oh!
 Bull's-eye.
 Look at 'em run.
 Yeah, cowards tend to do that.
 Goddamn it!
 Goddamn it!
 Would you care to?
 Can't see shit outta this!
 - He's getting away.
 - I got him.
 Big Daddy's getting away.
 I got him.
 Got him.
 The kid's a natural.
 How you know Broomhilda's first masters was German?
 Broomhilda is a German name.
 If they named her, it stands to reason they'd be German.
 Lots of gals where you're from named Broomhilda?
 Broomhilda is the name of a character in the most popular of all the German legends.
 There's a story about Broomhilda?
 Oh, yes, there is.
 - Do you know it?
 - Oh, every German knows that story.
 Would you like me to tell you?
 Well, Broomhilda was a princess.
 She was a daughter of Wotan, god of all gods.
 Anyway, her father is really mad at her.
 What she do?
 I can't exactly remember.
 She disobeys him in some way.
 So he puts her on top of the mountain.
 Broomhilda's on a mountain?
 It's a German legend, there's always going to be a mountain in there somewhere.
 And he puts a fire-breathing dragon there to guard the mountain.
 And he surrounds her in a circle of hellfire.
 And there, Broomhilda shall remain.
 Unless a hero arises brave enough to save her.
 Does a fella arise?
 Yes, Django, as a matter of fact, he does.
 A fella named Siegfried.
 Does Siegfried save her?
 Quite spectacularly so.
 He scales the mountain, because he's not afraid of it.
 He slays the dragon, because he's not afraid of him.
 And he walks through hellfire because Broomhilda's worth it.
 I know how he feel.
 I think I'm just starting to realize that.
 Now, look, Django I don't doubt that one day you'll save your lady love but I can't let you go to Greenville in a good conscience.
 A slave auction town in Mississippi isn't the place for you to visit.
 Free or not, it's just too dangerous.
 But let me ask you a question.
 How do you like the bounty hunting business?
 Kill white folks and they pay you for it?
 What's not to like?
 Now, I have to admit, we make a good team.
 I thought you was mad at me for killin' Big John and Lil Raj.
 Yeah, on that occasion you were a tad overzealous, but normally, that's a good thing.
 How'd you like to partner up for the winter?
 What you mean
"partner up
"?
 You work with me through the winter till the snow melts I give you a third of my bounties.
 So we make some money this winter, and when the snow melts, I'll take you to Greenville myself and we'll find where they sent your wife.
 Why you care what happen to me?
 Why you care if I find my wife?
 Frankly I've never given anybody their freedom before.
 And now that I have, I feel vaguely responsible for you.
 Plus, when a German meets a real life Siegfried, that's kind of a big deal.
 As a German, I'm obliged to help you on your quest to rescue your beloved Broomhilda.
 You got her.
 Ooh.
 What happened to Mr.

"I Wanna Shoot White Folks For Money
"?
 - His son's with him.
 - Well, good.
 He'll have a loved one with him.
 Maybe even share a last word.
 That's better than most of them get.
 Damn sight better than he deserves.
 Put down the rifle.
 Don't worry, I'm not mad at you.
 Let's take out Smitty Bacall's handbill.
 Read it aloud.
 Consider that today's lesson.

"Wanted.
 Dead or alive.
 Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall - Gang.
 -
"Gang.

"
"For murder and stagecoach robbery.
 - Seven-zero-zero-zero.
.
 - Seven thousand.
 Thousand.

"$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.
 $1,500 for each of his .
â€œgangâ€œP - Mem -
"Members.
 Known members of the Smitty Bacall Gang are as follas:
" - Follows.
 -
"Follows.

"
"Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash and
" Crazy Craig Koons.
 That is who Smitty Bacall is.
 If Smitty Bacall wanted to start a farm at 22, they would never have printed that.
 But Smitty Bacall wanted to rob stagecoaches and he didn't mind killing people to do it.
 Do you want to save your wife by doing what I do?
 This is what I do.
 I kill people and sell their corpses for cash.
 This corpse is worth $7,000.
 Now quit your pussyfooting and shoot him.
 Pa?
 Pa!
 Here.
 You need to keep this Smitty Bacall handbill.
 - Why?
 - It's good luck.
 You always keep the handbill of your first bounty.
 That's accurate.
 Doctor, Django, how the hell are ya?
 Who the hell-a you got there?
 The Wilson-Lowe Gang.
 Who the hell is the Wilson-Lowe Gang?
 Bad Chuck Wilson and meaner Bobby Lowe and three of their acolytes.
 Huh.
 Well, just leave 'em out here, they ain't going nowhere.
 Why don't you come in then out of the snowy snow and get yourselves some coffee.
 We had a birthday yesterday.
 Got some cake.
 Pretty good.
 Move along!
 Move it, boy!
 Keep movin'.
 Get on up on that auction block.
 Don't let that mud slow you down.
 Keep going.
 Keep goin'!

"Broomhilda Von Shaft.
 Age 27.
 'R' on right cheek.

" Calvin Candie.
 He owns the fourth biggest cotton - Candyland.
 Candyland?
 Oh, so you've heard of it.
 Ain't no slave ain't heard of Candyland.
 Well, apparently, that's where your wife is and that's the repellant gentleman who owns her.
 Let's just hope she works in the house, not in the field.
 Oh, no, she ain't no field nigger.
 She she pretty.
 And she talk good, too.
 But when they tore her back up and then they burned that runaway
"r
" on her cheek they goddamned her.
 She ain't no field nigger but she ain't good enough for the house no more either.
 They gonna try to make her a comfort girl.
 What's a comfort?
 Oh.
 Not while I got freedom.
 Not while I got my gun.
 So do we offer to buy her?
 So say a man wants to buy a horse.
 Needs to buy a horse.
 He walks up to the farmer's farm, and he knocks on the farmer's door and asks the farmer to buy his horse.
 And do you know what the farmer says?
 The farmer says no.
 Well, I say fuck that farmer, and I'm stealin' that horse.
 Fair enough.
 But now you're a horse thief, and they hang horse thieves.
 Not to mention the horse goes back to its original owner because the horse is still his property.
 We need her and we need a bill of sale.
 Well, if we ain't gonna try to buy her, then how we gonna get her?
 May I offer an alternative plan of action?
 Go ahead.
 So the man walks up to the farmer's farm, he knocks on the farmer's door and asks not to buy the horse, but the farm.
 And makes an offer so ridiculous, the farmer is forced to say yes.
 - We gonna offer to buy Candyland?
 - No, it's far too big.
 But apparently this farmer ain't all about the farm.
 How much do you know about Mandingo fighting?
 What?
 Can you convincingly masquerade as someone who is an expert on Mandingo fighting?
 Why?
 Because my character is that of a big money buyer from Dusseldorf, here in Greenville to buy my way into the Mandingo fight game.
 And your character is a Mandingo expert I hired to help me do it.
 They call that
"One-Eyed Charley.

" Bonjour.
 We're here to see Mr.
 Calvin Candie.
 Entraz.
 - Thank you.
 - Hm-mm.
 You want me to play a black slaver?
 Ain't nothin' lower than a black slaver.
 A black slaver is lower than the head house nigger and, buddy, that's pretty fuckin' low.
 Then play him that way.
 Give me your black slaver.
 â™ª Along came the 219 Toot!
 Toot!
 Peanut butter!
 Dr.
 Schultz!
 - Good to see you again!
 - Mr.
 Moguy.
 Thank you for your assistance in creating the opportunity - for this appointment.
 - Nonsense, it's my job.
 So this is the One-Eyed Charley I've heard so much about.
 Yes, this is Django Freeman.
 Django, this is Mr.
 Candie's lawyer, Leonide Moguy.
 Just call me Leo.
 Calvin's in the Julius Caesar room.
 You all wanna follow me?
 How long have you been associated with Mr.
 Candie?
 Oh, Calvin's father and I were about 11 when we went to boarding school together.
 Calvin's father's father put me through law school.
 One could almost say I was raised to be Calvin's lawyer.
 One could almost say youse a nigger.
 What did you say?
 - I said - Nothing, he's just being cheeky.
 Uh, anything else about Mr.
 Candie that I should know before I meet him?
 Yes, he is a bit of a Francophile.
 What civilized people aren't?
 And he prefers Monsieur Candie to Mr.
 Candie.
 He doesn't speak French.
 Don't speak French to him, it'll embarrass him.
 Get back on top, now!
 Turn around!
 There you go.
 There you go.
 Why do you want to get in the Mandingo business?
 You don't intend to allow your second to make the proper introductions?
 Quit stalling, now.
 Answer the question.
 The awful truth?
 I'm bored.
 This seems like a good bit of fun.
 Well, come on over.
 We got us a fight goin' on that's a good bit of fun.
 Won't you accompany me to the bar?
 You don't wear a hat in the house, white man.
 Even I know that.
 - Dr.
 Schultz.
 - What a rare pleasure.
 Keep fighting, niggers.
 - And I might add, an honor.
 - Honor to meet you.
 Please have a seat, the pleasure's all mine.
 Get free man Django here whatever he wants.
 And I'll have sweet tea and bourbon.
 Use your weight, boy, use your weight!
 There you go.
 He's much bigger and stronger!
 Come on, now!
 He's not doing what I told him, for God's sakes.
 Come on, now, boy!
 It's a fight to the death!
 You either hit him or are you ain't?
 Big Fred, come on!
 Turn him around!
 Now Use your strength, boy!
 Come on, now!
 Use your strength!
 There you go!
 There you go!
 Look at that.
 See, I told you to put some more power in there.
 Do what I told you, boy!
 There you go!
 - No!
 - Do what I told ya!
 Blind him black, boy!
 Blind him black!
 Oh, no, Luigi.
 Whoo!
 Whoo-hoo-hoo!
 Oh Finish him.
 Go on, boy, finish him!
 That's why they call him Big Fred.
 - Worth every penny.
 - Well, arrivederci, Luigi.
 Come on up, now, boy.
 Get yourself a rest.
 You did a fine job.
 A real fine job.
 Mercedes.
 Tequila.
 What's your name?
 Django.
 Can you spell it?
 D-J-A-N-G-O.
 The D is silent.
 I know.
 Mr.
 Moguy, want you to take care of my new boy here.
 You find him a room with a soft bed, then you bring him up a pony to lick his pole.
 But you be ready to travel to Candyland tomorrow morning, now, ya hear?
 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
 Before you go, Roscoe, get Fred here a tall beer.
 You enjoy that, boy.
 You've earned it.
 Yessir.
 - What's your name, boy?
 - His name is Django Freeman.
 Where'd you dig him up?
 A fortuitous turn of events brought Django and myself together.
 I've heard tell about you.
 I heard you been telling everybody them Mandingos ain't no damn good.
 Ain't nothin' nobody is sellin' is worth buyin'.
 I'm curious what makes you such a Mandingo expert?
 I'm curious what makes you so curious.
 - What did you say, boy?
 - Calm down, Butch.
 No offense given none taken.
 Monsieur Candie I'd appreciate if you could direct your line of inquiry toward me.
 One you do not have anything to drink.
 Can I get you a tasty refreshment?
 - Yes!
 I'll have a beer.
 - Wunderbar.
 Roscoe, a beer for the man with the beard, and I will have a Polynesian Pearl Diver.
 Do not spare the rum.
 Doc I am a seasoned slaver.
 You are, well, you are a neophyte.
 I'm simply tryin' to ascertain if this cowboy here is takin' advantage of you.
 With all due respect, Monsieur Candie I didn't seek you out for your advice.
 I sought you out to purchase a fighting nigger at above top-dollar market price.
 Now I was under the impression, when you granted me an audience, it would be to discuss business.
 Well, we weren't talkin' business yet.
 We were discussin' my curiosity.
 Thank you.
 Roscoe, Coco, go outside and play.
 Sheba you stay right there.
 I know you didn't mean me.
 - Prost!
 - German.
 Now, according to Moguy, if I do business with you, I'm doing business with both y'all.
 He does the eyeballin', you the billfold?
 Is that it?
 Well, you don't make it sound too flattering, but more or less, yeah.
 Hm.
 So Bright Boy Moguy tells me you looked over my African flesh and you was none too impressed, huh?
 Not for top dollar.
 Well, then, we got nothin' more to talk about.
 You see, you wanna buy a beat-ass nigger from me, those are the beat-ass niggers I wanna sell so He don't wanna buy the niggers you wanna sell.
 He wants the nigger you don't wanna sell.
 Well, I don't sell the niggers I don't wanna sell.
 Well, you won't sell your best.
 You won't even sell your second best.
 But your third best?
 You don't want to sell him either.
 But if I made you an offer so ridiculous you'd be forced to consider it who knows what could happen?
 And what do you consider ridiculous?
 For a truly talented specimen, the right nigger?
 How much would you say, Django?
 Twelve thousand dollars.
 Well, gentlemen, you had my curiosity, but now you have my attention.
 Willie.
 Willie.
 Hold up!
 Hold up.
 Ah!
 - Good morning, gentlemen.
 - Good Dr.
 Schultz.
 - Beautiful morning, isn't it?
 - You couldn't have picked a better one.
 Please, won't you take a ride with us here in the Victoria.
 Oh, thank you very much.
 You can tie your horse up back there.
 Django.
 Where I part company from many of my phrenologist colleagues is I believe there is a level above bright, above talented, above loyal that a nigger can aspire to.
 Say, one nigger that just pops up in 10,000.
 The exceptional nigger.
 Bright day, huh, Bright Boy?
 Sun is up.
 Shining on all of us.
 - Have a seat, doc.
 - Thank you.
 Quite an honor.
 - The honor is all ours.
 - Thank you.
 But I do believe that, given time, exceptional niggers like Bright Boy here become if not frequent more frequent.
 Bright Boy, you are that one in 10,000.
 The name of the game is keep up, not catch up, nigger.
 Whoa!
 - Touch your guns, you die.
 - Everybody, calm down!
 Now I saw the whole thing.
 No harm done.
 Are you kidding me?
 - This nigger just - I said no harm done!
 Now take your hand off your pistol!
 Butch, that means you too.
 Everybody stop antagonizing my guest.
 Hoot!
 Get back up on your horse.
 He broke my collarbone!
 For God's sake, somebody please help Hoot here back up on his goddamn horse.
 - Yessir, boss.
 - Oh, now you are one lucky nigger.
 You better listen to your boss, white boy.
 Oh, I'm gonna go walking in the moonlight with you.
 You wanna hold my hand?
 Willie, take us home.
 Start moving!
 Head 'em out!
 You got a problem with your eyeball, boy?
 No, sir.
 You want a boot heel in it?
 No, sir.
 Then you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
 You flash that bad look at me again, I'll give you a reason not to like me.
 Now move, nigger!
 You niggers are gonna understand something about me.
 I'm worse than any of these white men here.
 You get the molasses out your ass, you keep your goddamn eyeballs off me.
 He is a rambunctious sort, ain't he?
 Indeed.
 May we stop for a moment so I may put a word in my man's ear?
 You know, I'm expecting to fall in love once I see the specimens at Candyland, so before that moment, it would be good if I could have a confidential strategy meeting with my confidant.
 You mind telling me what the hell you doing?
 I confirmed that Broomhilda's at Candyland.
 - You're sure it's her?
 - He didn't call her by name, but she's a young lady, whip marks on her back and speaks German.
 Now, while it's not wise to assume, in this instance, I think it's pretty safe.
 Point being, don't get so carried away with your retribution.
 You lose sight of why we're here.
 - You think I lost sight of that?
 - Yes, I do.
 Stop antagonizing Candie.
 You're going to blow this whole charade, or more than likely get us both killed.
 And I, for one, don't intend to die in Chickasaw County, Mississippi, USA.
 I'm not antagonizing him.
 I'm intriguing him.
 You're yelling abuse at these poor slaves.
 I recall the man who had me kill another man in front of his son and he didn't bat a eye.
 You remember that?
 Yeah, of course I remember.
 What you said was that this is my world and in my world you gotta get dirty.
 So that's what I'm doing.
 I'm gettin' dirty.
 Well, you're paraphrasing a tad, but that was the general gist.
 See you at Candyland.
 All right, niggers, back at it.
 That means you too, Moonlight.
 I'll be.
 D'Artagnan!
 Now, boy, why do a fool thing like run off?
 I can't fight no more, Monsieur Candie.
 Yes, you can.
 You might not be able to win, but your ass can fight.
 Mr.
 Stonesipher, would you please shut these goddamn dogs up?
 - I cannot hear myself think!
 - Quiet down, Marsha!
 Marsha, hush up!
 Marsha!
 Hush up!
 Hey!
 Get these goddamn dogs away from this nigger!
 Come on now, boy get on out that tree.
 Yessir.
 How long was he loose?
 A night.
 Day.
 Half the other night.
 How far he get off the property?
 'Bout 20 miles off the prop.
 Pretty far considering that limp he got.
 Hm.
 Mr.
 Moguy, who was D'Artagnan supposed to fight on Friday?
 One-a this new lot.
 Well, way he looks now, a blind Indian wouldn't bet a bead on him.
 Please, Monsieur Candie, I ain't got it in me no more.
 - Now, now, now, now, now.
 - I can't Now, no beggin'.
 No playin' on my soft heart.
 - You in trouble now, son.
 - Yessir.
 I done paid $500 for you.
 When I pay $500, then I expect to get five fights out of a nigger - 'fore he roll over and play dead.
 - Sir.
 You got to understand that I'm runnin' a business here.
 - You fought three fights.
 - But I won every one.
 Yes, you did.
 Yes, you did.
 But that last one, you muddled the line between winnin' and losin'.
 Yessir.
 Still, the fact remains: I pay $500, I want five goddamn fights!
 So what about my $500, huh?
 What about my $500?
 You gonna reimburse me?
 You even know what
"reimburse
" means?
 Huh?
 I'll reimburse you!
 You Will?
 Yep.
 You'll pay $500 for practically a one-eyed old Joe ain't fit to push a broom?
 No, he won't.
 He just tired of you toyin' with him is all.
 Matter of fact, so am I.
 But we ain't payin' a penny for that pickaninny.
 Ain't got no use for him.
 Ain't that right, doc?
 You heard him.
 You're gonna have to excuse Mr.
 Stonesipher's slack-jawed gaze.
 He ain't never seen a nigger like you ever in his life.
 Ain't that right, Mr.
 Stonesipher?
 That right.
 For that matter nor have I.
 Now seein' as you won't pay a penny for this pickaninny here you won't mind me handlin' this nigger any way I see fit?
 He's your nigger.
 Mr.
 Stonesipher?
 Let Marsha and her bitches send D'Artagnan to nigger heaven.
 Marsha!
 Marsha, hey, get him!
 Get 'im, get 'im!
 - Yeah!
 - Whoo!
 Whoo-ee!
 Your boss looks a little green around the gills for a blood sport like nigger fighting.
 Nah, he just ain't used to seein' a man ripped apart by dogs is all.
 Hm.
 You are used to it?
 I'm just a little more used to Americans than he is.
 - Hm.
 - Now, Monsieur Candie whenever you're ready.
 We rode five hours so you could show off your stock.
 Let's get to it.
 'Cause as of now, if he's an example, I ain't impressed.
 Follow me.
 Line 'em up to the left here now, boy.
 Stand up straight, now!
 Get up there.
 Get up there, boy.
 Come on.
 Give me a line!
 Give me a line!
 Get in line there!
 Straighten up!
 Hello!
 Stephen, my boy!
 Yeah, yeah, yeah.
 Hello, my ass.
 Who this nigger up on that nag?
 Stephen, you have nails for breakfast?
 What's-a matter?
 Why you so ornery?
 - You miss me, huh?
 - Oh, yessir.
 I miss you like a hog miss slop!
 Like a baby miss mammy's titty.
 I miss you like I misses a rock in my shoe.
 Now, I axed you: Who this nigger on that nag?
 Hey, Snowball?
 Wanna know my name or the name of my horse, you ask me.
 Just who the hell you callin'
"Snowball,
" horse boy?
 I'll snatch your black ass off that nag there - and in the mud so fast - Whoa, whoa, whoa!
 - make your head spin.
 - Stephen, Stephen, Stephen.
 Let's keep it funny.
 Django here's a free man.
 - This nigger here?
 - That nigger there.
 Let me at least introduce the two of you.
 Django, this is another cheeky black bugger like yourself, Stephen.
 Stephen, this here's Django.
 You two oughta hate each other.
 Calvin, just who the hell is this nigger you feels the need to entertain?
 Django and his friend in gray here, Dr.
 Schultz, are customers.
 And they are our guests, Stephen.
 And you, you old decrepit bastard, oughta show them every hospitality.
 - You understand that?
 - Yessir.
 Him I understand.
 But I don't know why I got to take lip off this nigger.
 You don't have to know why.
 Do you understand?
 Yessir.
 I understand.
 Well, good.
 They're spendin' the night.
 Go up in the guest bedrooms and get two ready.
 He gonna stay in The Big House?
 Stephen, he's a slaver.
 It's different.
 - In The Big House?
 - Well, you got a problem with that?
 Oh, no.
 I ain't got no problem with it, if you ain't got no problem with burnin' the bed, the sheets, the pillowcases, everything else when this black-ass motherfucker's gone!
 That is my problem!
 They are mine to burn!
 Now your problem right now is makin' a good impression!
 And I want you to start solvin' that problem right now and get them goddamn rooms ready!
 Yessir, Monsieur Candie.
 Go on, now.
 Can't believe you brought a nigger to stay in The Big House.
 Your daddy rollin' over in his goddamned grave.
 Man, the lip on him.
 Whoo!
 He's gettin' worse and worse.
 Now Where is my beautiful sister?
!
 There she is!
 Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
 Dr.
 Schultz, this attractive Southern belle is my widowed sister.
 Darlin', you are a tonic for tired eyes.
 May I present to you Lara Lee Candie-Fitzwilly.
 Chester, Rodney, Chicken Charly.
 Y'all get your ass over by that pen.
 - Come on, Charly.
 Come on, now!
 - Let's go.
 You know where it is.
 Like you on a rope!
 Niggers don't walk around here, niggers run!
 - Monsieur Candie?
 - Hm?
 Yeah.
 About that matter about the nigger girl you were talking about?
 Nigger gal?
 Yeah, I believe you mentioned she spoke German.
 Ah, yes!
 Hildi, what about her?
 Do you think before the demonstration, you could send her around to my room?
 You little dickens, you.
 I don't see why not.
 Stephen, when you get through showin' them to their rooms, go fetch Hildi, get her cleaned up and smellin' real nice, and sent over to Dr.
 Schultz's room here.
 Actually, Monsieur Candie, sir, there's-a somethin' I ain't told you 'bout yet.
 - What?
 - Uh, Hildi in the Hot Box.
 What's she doin' there?
 What you think she doin' there in the Hot Box?
 She bein' punished.
 - What she do?
 - She run off again.
 Jesus Christ, Stephen, how many people ran away while I was gone?
 - Two.
 - When did she go?
 Last night.
 They brung her back this morning.
 How bad did Stonesipher's dogs tear her up?
 Lucky for her, they was out chasin' D'Artagnan's ass.
 Bill and Cody went lookin' for her, found her, brung her back.
 Now, she a little beat-up.
 But she done that to her own damn self runnin' through them damn bushes and shit.
 How long she been in the box?
 How long you think she been in there?
 All damn day.
 And the little bitch got ten more days to be in there.
 - Still, take her out.
 - Take her out?
 Why?
 Because I said so, that's why.
 Dr.
 Schultz is my guest.
 Hildi is my nigger.
 Southern hospitality dictates I make her available to him.
 - But, Monsieur Candie, she run off.
 - Jesus Christ, Stephen.
 What is the point of havin' a nigger that speaks German if you can't wheel 'em out when you have a German guest?
 Now, I realize it is inconvenient, but still, you take her ass out.
 Yessir.
 Lara Lee!
 Will you and Cora be responsible for gettin' Hildi cleaned up and presentable for Dr.
 Schultz here.
 Of course, darlin'.
 Now, gentlemen, I do apologize, but I am weary from our travels beyond words.
 It is time for me to rest my tired eyes.
 Y'all done heard the man!
 Get her ass up outta there!
 Cora!
 Come here!
 Get over there and get her cleaned up, bring her back over here to Dr - What he say your name is?
 Shoots?
 - Schultz.
 Schultz.
 Get her back over here.
 Hurry up, girl.
 Yessir.
 Come on, girl.
 Stand up.
 Is you comin' with me or is you gonna sleep in that little box over yonder?
 Hello, ladies.
 Dr.
 Schultz.
 May I introduce to you Broomhilda?
 Hildi, this is Dr.
 Schultz.
 It's a pleasure to meet you, Broomhilda.
 I've heard a lot of good things about you.
 Well, it's not every nigger speaks German, don't ya know.
 As I look at you now, Broomhilda, I can see all the passions you inspire are completely justified.
 The doctor here speaks German.
 And I've been informed you do as well?
 Go ahead, girl.
 Speak a little German.
 Ha!
 Astonishing.
 - And I shall bring you - Much obliged.
 Ja.
 Don't be afraid.
 Hm.
 Pardon.
 Danke.
 Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
 You silver-tongued devil, you.
 - Hurry up, girl.
 - These ready, Miss Cora.
 No, no, no, they drinkin' tonight.
 Go downstairs, get the big jug with the red stuff Monsieur Candie like, hear?
 - Get your big pretty ass out the way.
 - You know you like it.
 That's 'cause you knows what I like.
 Ooh!
 Come on with these biscuits, girl.
 Look, Monsieur Candie, they were all fine specimens, no doubt about it.
 But the best three by far were Samson - What's that other one's name?
 - Goldie.
 Goldie.
 And Eskimo Joe.
 By the way, why is he called Eskimo Joe?
 You never know how these nigger nicknames get started.
 His name was Joe, maybe one day he said he was cold.
 Who knows?
 Well, regardless, Samson's your best.
 We all know that.
 You will never sell him, and I can see why.
 He's a champion.
 Hm-hm.
 All three are champions.
 Samson's the champion.
 Them other two pretty good.
 Calvin, now what's this nigger you let It's all right.
 You have to understand, Monsieur Candie, while admittedly a neophyte in the nigger fight game, I do have a little bit of a background in the European traveling circus.
 Is that right?
 Hence, I have big ideas when it comes to presentation.
 Hm.
 I need something more than just a big nigger.
 Yeah, he needs to have panache.
 - Need to have what?
 What?
 - Panache.
 Uh - A sense of Showmanship.
 - Showmanship, yes.
 I want to be able to bill him as The Black Hercules.
 The Black Hercules, isn't that clever?
 More like Nigger-les.
 I said, and I quote:
"I would pay top dollar for 'the right nigger.

"' Now I'm not saying that Eskimo Joe is the wrong nigger, per se.
 But is he right as rain?
 Oh, Dr.
 Schultz, I will have you know there is no one in the nigger fight game that appreciates the value of showmanship more than Monsieur Calvin J.
 Candie here.
 Nobody.
 But one must not forget the most important thing - in the nigger fight game.
 - Hm-mm.
 And that is a nigger that can win fights.
 Hm-mm.
 Now that should be your first, second, third, fourth, and fifth concern.
 Now, after you have that, and you know you have that, then you can start to implement a grand design.
 In other words, first thing is first.
 First thing's first.
 Ooh!
 I see you two gettin' on.
 Famously.
 Oh, Monsieur Candie, you can't imagine what it's like not to hear your native tongue in four years.
 Well, hell, I can't imagine two weeks in Boston.
 Two weeks in Boston!
 Monsieur Candie, you a mess!
 Two weeks in Boston!
 I can't express the joy I felt conversing in my mother tongue.
 And Hildi is a charming conversation companion.
 Well, be careful now, Dr.
 Schultz.
 You might-a caught yourself - a little dose of nigger love.
 - Hm!
 Nigger love's a powerful emotion, boy.
 - Hm!
 - It's like a pool of black tar.
 Once it catches your ass, you're caught.
 Yessir, you stuck.
 I don't know, doctor.
 You can lay on all the German sweet talk you want, but it looks like this pony's got big eyes for Django.
 Well, naturally.
 It is the soaring eagle that attracts her attention, not the plucked chicken.
 Dr.
 Schultz, don't be so down on yourself.
 You are quite the dapper European gentleman.
 You got to clean these dishes, you got to put your elbow in these dishes, you hear me?
 You know that nigger, don't you?
 - Who?
 -
"Who?

" Don't
"who
" me, bitch.
 You know who I'm talkin' about.
 At the table?
 I don't know him.
 - You don't know him.
 - No.
 -
"No,
" what?
 - No, sir.
 You wouldn't lie to me, now, would you?
 OK.
 Yeah.
 If you say so.
 Eskimo Joe's a quality nigger, no doubt about it.
 But if it was my money, I wouldn't pay no $12,000 for him.
 What would your price be?
 Well, if I was inclined to be generous and I don't know why I would be inclined to be generous 9,000.
 Maybe.
 Dr.
 Schultz, let me reclarify how this whole negotiation came about.
 You see, it wasn't me who came to you to sell a nigger.
 Sure wasn't.
 It was you who approached me to buy one.
 - Sure was.
 - Now, that $9,000 figure Bright Boy's been bandyin' about, that ain't too far off from right.
 And if I wanted to sell Eskimo Joe for that, - I could do so any day of the week.
 - Any day.
 But, like you said in Greenville, doctor I don't want to sell him.
 It was only your ridiculous offer of $12,000 - that made me even consider it.
 - Hm-mm.
 You know, Monsieur Candie, you do possess the power of persuasion.
 Why not?
 Monsieur Candie, you have a deal.
 - Eskimo Joe, $12,000.
 - Hooray, doctor.
 Hooray.
 And a wise decision that is.
 However, that is a tremendous amount of money.
 And the way you have your Mr.
 Moguy, I have a lawyer.
 Persnickety man named Tuttle.
 And I would need my Mr.
 Tuttle to draw up a legal contract before I'd feel comfortable exchanging that amount of money for flesh.
 Hm-mm.
 Not to mention having Eskimo Joe examined - by a physician of my choosing.
 - Naturally.
 So, say I return in about - five days time.
 - Five days?
 With my Mr.
 Tuttle.
 And then my Mr.
 Tuttle and your Mr.
 Moguy can hash out the finer details between themselves.
 I say splendid, doctor.
 Splendid.
 Gentlemen may I propose a toast.
 To Eskimo Joe.
 Or shall we call him The Black Hercules?
 To The Black Hercules.
 The Black Hercules.
 To The Black Hercules.
 You was right, doctor.
 That name do have pan-ass.
 Hm.
 Hildi, top my drink off.
 So, Hildi, how you like servin' at the big table in The Big House, huh?
 When Monsieur Candie talk to you, you answers.
 - I like it a lot, Monsieur Candie.
 - Hm-mm.
 It's a lot better than sizzlin' in that Hot Box or draggin' your ass through a bramble bush.
 But maybe it's not quite as much fun as gettin' to pleasure all them Mandingos, - huh, sugar bear?
 - Oh, Lord, she like them niggers.
 - Sure do.
 - Like Samson?
 Huh?
 No, sir.
 You know, Monsieur Candie, the doctor here might be interested in seein' Hildi's peeled back, seein' as how they don't have many niggers where he come from.
 Dr.
 Schultz, when you was alone with Hildi, here, did you just speak German or did you get to take her clothes off?
 No, we just talked and Oh, so you haven't seen her back?
 - I haven't - No, no, no, no.
 Stephen's right, you might find this interesting.
 Hildi, go on, take off your dress.
 Show Dr.
 Schultz your back here.
 - Go on.
 - Uh, Calvin.
 I just got her all dressed up and lookin' nice.
 But, Lara Lee, Dr.
 Schultz is from Dusseldorf.
 They don't got niggers there.
 He is a man of medicine.
 I'm sure it would fascinate him, the niggers' endurance for pain.
 These niggers are tough, Dr.
 Schultz, no doubt about it.
 Hildi's got somethin' like four lashes on her back.
 Lara Lee just get one, she'd lose her goddamn mind.
 - Sure would.
 - Look at that, doctor.
 - It's like a paintin'.
 Look at that.
 - Calvin!
 We are eating.
 Ain't no one wanna look at her whipped up back.
 Fine.
 Fine, fine, fine, fine.
 After dinner, then, Stephen.
 After dinner.
 During the brandies, gentlemen, hm?
 Cora, come get this girl!
 - She a mess.
 - Yes, ma'am.
 Oh!
 Why are you all undone?
 I just got you done up.
 Come on in here.
 Baby, you on Stephen bad side, and you need to be on his blind side.
 You say you ain't know him.
 Huh?
 I said, you said you ain't know him.
 - I don't.
 - Yes, you do.
 Mr.
 Stephen I don't.
 Why is you lying to me?
 I ain't.
 Then why is you crying?
 You scarin' me.
 - Why is I'm scaring you?
 - Because you scary.
 To speak German this afternoon with Hildi was positively soul-enriching.
 Doctor, that warms my heart to hear that.
 You stay right here.
 You indicated earlier you'd be willing to part with Hildi.
 Why, yes.
 Yessiree bob, I did.
 In that case, allow me to propose another proposition.
 I'm all ears.
 Hurry up, goddamn it!
 - Monsieur Candie - Stephen!
 You just interrupted Dr.
 Schultz here.
 I'm sorry, Dr.
 Schultz.
 My ears ain't worth a damn these days.
 Excuse him.
 Monsieur Candie, could I get a word with you in the kitchen?
 You mean get up out of my chair?
 - If'n you could manage it.
 - Why?
 - It's about dessert.
 - What about dessert?
 I'd rather discuss that in private.
 We're having white cake!
 What sort of melodrama could be brewing back there?
 You right, Monsieur Candie.
 You right.
 I'll handle it myself.
 Meet me in the library.
 I just can't understand why you won't come talk to these niggers.
 Shit get fucked up around here, you blame me.
 Fine!
 Fine.
 Friend Stephen, I will be along momentarily.
 Yessir.
 Well, gentlemen, as you can see, talented as they are, no doubt, in the kitchen, from time to time, adult supervision is required.
 If you'll excuse me a moment.
 You may clear the dinner service.
 You heard him.
 Go on!
 Get!
 Hurry up, girl.
 So, Dr.
 Schultz, why don't you regale us with a tale of the circus.
 The circus?
 What is the matter?
 Them motherfuckers ain't here to buy no Mandingos.
 They wants that girl.
 Stephen, what the hell are you talking about?
 Hm?
 They playing your ass for a fool is what I'm talking about.
 They ain't here for no musclebound Jimmie.
 They here for that girl.
 Wh What girl?
 Hildi?
 Yeah, Hildi.
 Her and Django, them niggers know each other.
 He just bought Eskimo Joe.
 - Did he give you any money?
 - No!
 Not yet.
 But Then he ain't bought diddly.
 Not yet, nohow.
 But he's just about to buy who he come here to buy when I interrupted him.

"Thank you, Stephen.

" You're welcome, Calvin.
 Where you gettin' all this?
 Why would they go through all that trouble for a nigger with a chewed up back, ain't worth $300?
 They doin' it 'cause that nigger Django's in love with Hildi.
 She probably his wife.
 Now, why that German gives a fuck who that uppity son of a bitch is in love with, I'm sure I don't know.
 If she's who they want why this whole snake oil pitch about Mandingos, then?
 You wouldn't pay no never mind to no $300.
 But that 12,000?
 That made you real friendly, now, didn't it?
 Yes, it did.
 His wife, huh?
 If it had been a snake, it would have bit me.
 Those lying goddamn time-wastin' sons of bitches.
 Sons of bitches!
 out of New Orleans, so I have quite a bit of practice with theater types.
 Oh, there you are.
 I was beginning to think that you and that old crow run off together.
 That'd be a hell of a note, wouldn't it?
 Lara Lee, I was just looking out the big window.
 Billy Crash is out there dealing with some shady slaver trying to sell a passel of ponies.
 Would you be a dear, go out there and give them gals an eyeball?
 Hm?
 - Of course, brother.
 - Thank you, darling.
 - Yeah.
 Business never sleeps.
 - Hm-mm.
 Apropos, before your exit, we were discussing the possibility of my purchasing Broomhilda.
 Ah, yes.
 Yes, we were, doctor.
 And we will again.
 In a moment.
 Who's your little friend?
 This is Ben.
 He's a old Joe that lived around here for a long time.
 And I do mean a long damn time.
 Old Ben here took care of my daddy and my daddy's daddy.
 Till he up and keeled over one day Old Ben took care of me.
 Growing up the son of a huge plantation owner in Mississippi puts a white man in contact with a whole lotta black faces.
 I spent my whole life here, right here in Candyland surrounded by black faces.
 Now, seeing them every day, day in, day out, I only had one question: Why don't they kill us?
 Now, right out there on that porch, three times a week for 50 years, Old Ben here would shave my daddy with a straight razor.
 Now, if I was Old Ben, I woulda cut my daddy's goddamn throat and it wouldn't have taken me no 50 years to do it, neither.
 But he never did.
 Why not?
 You see, the science of phrenology is crucial to understanding the separation of our two species.
 In the skull of the African here, the area associated with submissiveness is larger than any human or any other subhuman species on planet Earth.
 If you examine this piece of skull here you will notice three distinct dimples.
 Here, here and here.
 Now if I was holding the skull of an Isaac Newton or Galileo, these three dimples would be found in the area of the skull most associated with creativity.
 But this is the skull of Old Ben.
 And in the skull of Old Ben, unburdened by genius, these three dimples exist in the area of the skull most associated with servility.
 Now, Bright Boy I will admit you are pretty clever.
 But if I took this hammer here and I bashed in your skull with it you would have the same three dimples in the same place as Old Ben.
 Hey!
 Now lay your palms flat on that tabletop!
 If you lift those palms off that turtle shell tabletop, Mr.
 Pooch is gonna let loose with both barrels of that sawed-off.
 There have been a lot of lies said around this dinner table here tonight, but that you can believe!
 Mr.
 Moguy, would you be so kind as to collect the pistol hanging off these boys' hips here?
 - Thank you ever so much.
 - Doctor.
 Where were we?
 Jackass.
 Ah, yes.
 I do believe you were just getting ready to make me a proposition to buy Broomhilda.
 Am I right?
 Right.
 Bring out Hildi!
 Get over there yonder.
 Sit your ass in that goddamn Lay your hand flat on that tabletop.
 Now shut your mouth!
 Dr.
 Schultz, in Greenville, you yourself said that for the right nigger you'd be willin' to pay what some may consider is a ridiculous amount.
 To which me myself said,
"What is your definition of ridiculous?

" To which you said,
"$12,000.

" Now, considering y'all have ridden a whole lot of miles, went through a whole lot of trouble, and done spread a whole lot of bull to purchase this lovely lady right here, it would appear that Broomhilda is, in fact the right nigger.
 And if y'all want to leave Candyland with Broomhilda, the price is $12,000.
 And I take it you prefer the
"take it or leave it
" style of negotiation?
 Yes, I do, doctor.
 You see, under the laws of Chickasaw County, Broomhilda here is my property.
 And I can choose to do with my property whatever I so desire!
 And if y'all think my price for this nigger here is too steep what I'm gonna desire to do is take this goddamn hammer here and beat her ass to death with it!
 - Right in front of both y'all!
 - Easy, big fella.
 Then we can examine the three dimples inside Broomhilda's skull!
 Now, what's it gonna be, doc?
 Huh?
 What's it gonna be?
 May I lift the hands off the tabletop in order to remove my billfold?
 Yes, you may.
 That 12.
 Sold!
 To the man with the exceptional beard and his unexceptional nigger.
 - Mr.
 Moguy.
 - Yes, Calvin?
 Will you make these gentlemen a receipt for $12,000, please?
 $12,000.
 It was a pleasure doing business with y'all.
 Now, gentlemen if you care to join me in the parlor we will be serving white cake.
 Well done, Calvin.
 Excuse me.
 Excuse me, ma'am?
 Could you please stop playing Beethoven?
 Take your hands off the harp!
 Doctor!
 - Doctor, you can't go in there!
 - Stephen, Stephen.
 He ain't got no business going in there.
 Let it be.
 He's just a little upset, that's all.
 I'll handle this.
 White cake?
 I don't go in for sweets, thank you.
 Hm.
 You brooding about me getting the best of you, huh?
 Actually, I was thinking of that poor devil you fed to the dogs today.
 D'Artagnan.
 And I was wondering what Dumas would make of all this.
 Come again?
 Alexandre Dumas.
 He wrote The Three Musketeers.
 Yes, of course, doctor.
 I figured you must be an admirer.
 You named your slave after his novel's lead character.
 Now, if Alexandre Dumas had been there today, I wonder what he would have made of it.
 You doubt he'd approve, huh?
 Yes.
 His approval would be a dubious proposition at best.
 Soft-hearted Frenchie.
 Alexandre Dumas is black.
 - Are these Broomhilda's papers?
 - Yes, they are.
 - May I?
 - Of course.
 Thank you.
 That is her bill of sale, her ownership history, and, of course, her freedom papers, doctor.
 Would you have ink and pen for me?
 - Right over there on that little table.
 - Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Broomhilda Von Shaft consider yourself a free woman.
 Mr.
 Candie normally, I would say auf Wiedersehen.
 But since what auf Wiedersehen actually means is
"till I see you again
" and since I never wish to see you again, to you, sir I say,
"goodbye.

" Let's go.
 Come on.
 One more moment, doctor!
 What?
 It's a custom here in the South once a business deal is concluded that the two parties shake hands.
 It implies good faith.
 - I'm not from the South.
 - But you are in my house, doctor.
 - So I'm afraid I must insist.
 - Insist?
 On what?
 That I shake your hand?
 Oh, then I'm afraid I must insist in the opposite direction.
 - You know what I think you are?
 - What you think I am?
 No, I don't.
 - I think you are a bad loser.
 - And I think you're an abysmal winner.
 Nevertheless, here in Chickasaw County, a deal ain't done until the two parties have shook hands.
 Even after all that paper signin', don't mean shit you don't shake my hand.
 If I don't shake your hand, you're gonna throw away $12,000?
 I don't think so.
 Mr.
 Pooch?
 If she tries to leave here before this nigger-loving German shakes my hand, you cut her ass down.
 You really want me to shake your hand?
 I insist.
 If you insist.
 No!
 Calvin!
 Calvin!
 I'm sorry.
 I couldn't resist.
 Ni99er's gone crazy!
 Help!
 Help, he's killing everyone!
 Ah!
 Holy!
 Shit!
 Son of a bitch!
 Damn it!
 Fuckin'!
 Get the!
 Damn it, son of a bitch!
 What?
 Fucking Goddamn it!
 What the fuck is going on?
 You shot me!
 - You stupid son of a bitch!
 - Sorry, Jessie!
 Who the fuck gave a nigger a goddamn gun?
 Aim low!
 Nigger!
 Gonna kill!
 God!
 Oh, my God!
 Motherfucker!
 Shit!
 Shit.
 Hold your fire!
 Hold your fire!
 Stop shootin', goddamn it!
 Django!
 What?
 We got your woman!
 Billy Crash here got his pistol upside her head.
 You don't stop all that carrying on, he gonna blow her goddamn brains out.
 And that ain't no threat, horse boy.
 That there is a promise.
 Or you can give up, throw your gun out - we won't kill Hildi.
 - Horseshit!
 Honest Injun, Django.
 I swear 'fore God.
 You give up, ain't no harm gonna come to her.
 And I'm supposed to believe your black ass?
 Personally, I don't give a good goddamn what you believe or don't believe!
 I believe if you don't give up in the next ten seconds, we gonna blow this bitch's brains out!
 Believe that!
 Don't do it.
 You give me up.
 - Six!
 - Just let me go.
 - Seven!
 - They got too much.
 - Django.
 - Eight!
 - I love you.
 - Nine!
 - Hold it!
 - No.
 L give UP- I can't hear you, nigger.
 I said I give up!
 No!
 No!
 Cock-a-doodle-do, nigger.
 So y'all bounty hunters, huh?
 I knew there was something fishy about y'all.
 We found your wanted posters and book of figures in your saddlebags.
 I got to say I ain't never heard of no black bounty hunter before.
 Black boy paid to kill white men?
 How'd you like that line of work?
 Probably pretty good while it lasted, huh?
 Time to say good night to them nuts, blackie.
 On three.
 One I got you.
 Two Calm down, now, here it comes.

" Captain?
 Miss Lara want to see you.
 Something to do with the Old Man's funeral.
 Oh, and she changed her mind 'bout snipping Django.
 She gonna give him to the LeQuint Dickey people.
 Well, she didn't waste a minute telling me.
 How disappointing.
 You leavin'.
 This here what you take with you.
 Your black ass has been all them motherfuckers at The Big House could talk about for the last few hours.
 Seem like white folk ain't never had a bright idea in they life was coming up with all kinds of ways to kill your ass.
 Now, mind you, most of them ideas had to do with fuckin' with your fun parts.
 Now, that may seem like a good idea, but truth is when you snip a nigger's nuts, most of them bleed out in, oh, about, hm seven minutes.
 Most of 'em.
 Well, more than most.

"Shitfire.
 The niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.

" And they still sayin',
"Let's whip him to death.

" Or
"Throw him to the Mandingos.

"
"Feed him to Stonesipher's dogs.

" And I said,
"What's so special about that?
 We do that shit all the time.
 Hell's bells, the niggers we sell to LeQuint Dickey got it worse than that.

" Lo and behold, out of nowhere, Miss Lara come up with the bright idea of giving your ass to the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company.
 And as a slave of the LeQuint Dickey Mining Company, henceforth, till the day you die, all day, every day, you will be swinging a sledgehammer, turning big rocks into little rocks.
 Now, when you get there, they gonna take away your name, give you a number and a sledgehammer, and say,
"Get to work!

" One word of sass, they cuts out your tongue.
 And they good at it too.
 You won't bleed out.
 Oh, they does that real good.
 They gonna work ya.
 All day, every day, till your back give out.
 Then they're gonna hit you in the head with a hammer, throw your ass down the nigger hole.
 And that will be the story of you, Django.
 And what's the golden rule, Frankie, eh?
 You don't root abos.
 Hey, white boy.
 I said, hey, white boy.
 Shut up, black.
 You ain't got nothing to say I want to hear.
 How'd you like to make $11,000?
 Do what, now?
 I said how'd you like to make $11,000?
 11,500, actually.
 What the fuck are you talking about?
 Back there at that plantation, Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune, just sittin' there.
 And y'all rode right past it.
 You be damned, blackie, we're not bandits.
 I ain't saying that.
 Nice thing about this fortune is it ain't illegal.
 You can't steal it.
 You got to earn it, white boy.
 You got something to say, mate, you say it.
 The $11,500 fortune waitin' for you back at Candyland is in the form of a
"Wanted Dead or Alive
" bounty on Smitty Bacall and the Bacall Gang.
 Who the fuck is Smitty Bacall?
 Smitty Bacall is the leader of this murderous gang of stagecoach robbers, the Bacall Gang.
 There's a $7,000
"Wanted Dead or Alive
" bounty on him, $1,500 for each of his three accomplices: Dandy Michaels, Gerald Nash, and Crazy Craig Koons.
 Now, all four of them gentlemen, they back there at Candyland laughing their ass off.
 You know why?
 'Cause they just got away with murder.
 But it ain't got to be that way.
 You and your mates, y'all can ride back there and y'all can go get that money.
 What'd these jokers do again?
 These sons of bitches, they killed innocent people.
 Stagecoach robbery.
 Innocent white people.
 I got the handbill right here in my pocket, if you let me get it.
 Get it out.

"Wanted.
 Dead or alive.
 Smitty Bacall and the Smitty Bacall Gang.

" - But you're a slave.
 -
"For murder
" - I ain't no goddamn slave.
 -
"and stagecoach robbery.

" Do I sound like a fuckin' slave?
 -
"$7,000 for Smitty Bacall.

" - Hm?
 - That's a shitload.
 - I'm a bounty hunter.
 Yesterday, as a free man, I rode into Candyland on a horse with my German white partner, Dr.
 King Schultz.
 We tracked the Bacall Gang all the way from Texas to Chickasaw County.
 We finally found their ass layin' low in Candyland.
 We went in there to get 'em, things went sour, my partner got killed, Calvin Candie got shot, then everybody there decided to blame me, so here I am.
 But y'all know I ain't on that manifest.
 And all y'all know I ain't supposed to be on this trip.
 But them four men is still back there, they're still wanted, and that 11,500 is up for grabs, and the last thing they'd expect is y'all ridin' back in there and gettin' it.
 What's the deal?
 You tell us who they are and we turn you loose?
 No, no,no, no.
 I ain't gonna tell you who they are.
 But, you give me a pistol, one of them horses, and $500 of that 11,500, and I'll point 'em out to you.
 This is a real handbill.
 Now just 'cause it's a real handbill doesn't mean that other bunch of malarkey is.
 Now why would a slave have a
"Wanted Dead or Alive
" handbill in his pocket?
 Did that black ride into Candyland yesterday?
 All right, I'm gonna ask you again.
 I want you to remember, I don't like liars.
 Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man on a horse yesterday?
 Yeah.
 They walked us from the Greenville auction, and he rode in on a horse with a white man.
 Now this white man, was the black his slave?
 He weren't no slave.
 - You fuckin' sure about that?
 - Damn sure.
 - What happened over in Candyland?
 - Bunch-a shootin'.
 Massa got shot.
 - Who shot him?
 - The German.
 Why'd he do that?
 Nigger and the German was actin' like they were slavers but they wasn't.
 - Well, what were they?
 - Bounty hunters.
 Fuck me, Roy.
 I mean, this could be big, mate.
 Well, smoke, you got a deal.
 - I got one more condition.
 - What's that?
 When we get there, when time come - you let me help you kill 'em.
 - Hey you're a funny bugger.
 - Cut him loose.
 - Yeah, yeah.
 You got yourself a deal, blackie.
 You got yourself a deal, mate.
 Hey!
 You're all right for a black fella.
 Oh, yeah.
 There we go.
 There you go, mate.
 Yeah.
 We're gonna give you that packhorse over there.
 What them saddlebags got in 'em?
 - Dynamite.
 - No.
 I ain't ridin' no horse with no goddamn dynamite on its back.
 I can understand that.
 Frankie, why don't you take them sticks off that horse and stick 'em in the nigger cage.
 A little dynamite for you black fellas to play with.
 Now, Floyd, you got that rifle up on the wagon, don't ya?
 Yeah, right.
 Why don't you give him your gun and gun belt?
 Righto.
 Now, don't drop the fuckin' thing, all right?
 I've just had the sights fixed and they're perfect.
 Oh, that's good to know.
 Throw me up that dynamite.
 - Jake!
 - Yeah?
 Get out there and see what's wrong with them goddamn dogs!
 D'Artagnan, motherfuckers!
 Hey!
 Auf Wiedersehen.
 It's me, baby.
 â™ª In the sweet â™ª By-and-by â™ª We will meet â™ª On that beautiful shore â™ª By-and-by â™ª By-and-by â™ª By-and-by â™ª We will meet - J' We will meet by-and-by - Cora?
 Would you prepare us some coffee?
 Sheba, you help her.
 Come on.
 â™ª In the sweet â™ª By-and-by â™ª Oh A' Oh, y'all gonna be together with Calvin in the by-and-by, all right.
 Just a bit sooner than y'all was expectin'.
 Billy Crash.
 Now, where were we?
 Oh, that's right.
 Last time I seen you, you had your hands on my Django!
 You black son of a bitch!
 The D is silent, hillbilly.
 Oh, no!
 Now, all you black folks, I suggest you get away from all these white folks.
 Not you, Stephen.
 You right where you belong.
 Cora, before you go, will you tell Miss Lara goodbye?
 - Do what now?
 - I said,
"Tell Miss Lara goodbye.

" Bye, Miss Lara.
 Y'all two run along now.
 Stephen, how you like my new duds?
 You know, before now I didn't know that burgundy was my color.
 I count six shots, nigger.
 I count two guns, nigger.
 You said in 76 years on this plantation, you seen all manner-a shit done to niggers.
 But I notice, you didn't mention kneecappin'.
 Oh, God!
 Motherfucker!
 Damn it!
 Seventy-six years, Stephen.
 How many niggers you think you see come and go, huh?
 Seven thousand?
 Eight thousand?
 Nine thousand?
 Nine thousand, nine hundred and ninety-nine?
 Every single word that came out of Calvin Candie's mouth was nothin' but horseshit.
 I am that one nigger in 10,000.
 You son of a bitch!
 You motherfucker!
 Oh, sweet Jesus, let me kill this nigger!
 You ain't gonna get away with this, Django!
 They gonna catch your black ass.
 You gonna be on the wanted posters now, nigger.
 The bounty hunters gonna be lookin' for you.
 You can run, nigger, but they gonna find your ass!
 And when they do, oh, Lord, what they gonna do to your ass!
 They ain't gonna just kill you, nigger!
 You done fucked up!
 This Candyland, nigger!
 You can't destroy Candyland!
 We been here!
 There's always gonna be a Candyland!
 Can't no nigger gunfighter kill all the white folks in the world!
 They gonna find your black ass!
 Django!
 You uppity son of a Hey, Little Trouble Maker.
 Hey, Big Trouble Maker.
 You know what they are going to call you?

"The fastest gun in the South.

" Let's get outta here.
 Who was that nigger?
 Forget it.
 It's too risky.
 I'm through doing that shit.
 You always say that.
 The same thing every time.

"I'm through, never again, too dangerous.

" I know that's what I always say.
 I'm always right too.
 - You forget about it in a day or two.
 - The days of me forgetting are over.
 The days of me remembering have just begun.
 You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like?
 - I sound like a sensible fuckin' man.
 - You sound like a duck.
 Quack, quack, quack.
 Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.
 Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack.
 - After tonight?
 - Correct.
 I got all tonight to quack.
 - Can I get anyone more coffee?
 - Oh, yes!
 - Thank you.
 - You're welcome.
 I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.
 Takin' more of a risk.
 Banks are easier.
 Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.
 They're insured.
 Why should they give a fuck?
 I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.
 Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone.
 He gives the phone to a teller.
 The bloke on the other end says
"We got this guy's little girl.
 If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.

" - Did it work?
 - Fuckin' right it worked.
 That's what I'm talkin' about.
 Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.
 Cleans the place out.
 They don't lift a fuckin' finger.
 Did they hurt the little girl?
 There probably never was a little girl.
 The point of the story isn't a little girl.
 The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.
 - You want to rob banks?
 - I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.
 I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing.
 No more liquor stores?
 What've we been talkin' about?
 Yeah, no more liquor stores.
 Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be.
 There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.
 Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English.
 You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about.
 They make it too personal.
 We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him.
 - I'm not gonna kill anybody.
 - I don't want to kill anybody either.
 But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.
 And if it's not the gooks it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations.
 You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.
 Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.
 See how far that gets you.
 Forget it.
 - We're out of it.
 - Well, what then, day jobs?
 - Not in this life.
 - What then?
 Garcon, coffee!
 This place.
 Garcon means boy.
 This place?
 A coffee shop?
 What's wrong with that?
 Nobody ever robs restaurants.
 Why not?
 Bars, liquor stores gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.
 Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down.
 They're not expectin' to get robbed.
 Not as expectin' anyway.
 I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.
 Correct.
 Same as banks, these places are insured.
 Manager.
 He don't give a fuck.
 They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.
 Waitresses.
 Fuckin' forget it.
 No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.
 Busboys.
 Some wetback gettin' paid $1 .
50 an hour really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner?
 Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.
 One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.
 See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember?
 - All the customers kept comin' in.
 - Yeah.
 You got the idea of takin' their wallets.
 Now, that was a good idea.
 Thank you.
 Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.
 - Yes, we did.
 - A lot of people come to restaurants.
 A lot of wallets.
 Pretty smart, huh?
 Pretty smart.
 I'm ready.
 Let's do it.
 Right now, right here.
 - Come on.
 - All right.
 Same as last time, remember?
 You're crowd control.
 I'll handle the employees.
 - I love you, pumpkin.
 - I love you, honey bunny.
 Everybody be cool!
 This is a robbery!
 Any of you fucking pricks move and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.
 - Jungle boogie - Get down with the boogie.
 - Jungle boogie - Get it on.
 - Jungle boogie - Get down with the boogie.

 - Jungle boogie - Get up with the get down.
 - Jungle boogie - Get down and boogie.
 - Jungle boogie - Shake it around.
 - Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars.
 - Okay, what you want to know?
 - Hash is legal there, right?
 - Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.
 You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away.
 I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.
 - Those are hash bars?
 - Yeah.
 It breaks down like this.
 It's legal to buy it.
 It's legal to own it.
 And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.
 It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.
 If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you.
 I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.
 Oh, man!
 I'm goin'.
 That's all there is to it.
 I'm fuckin' goin'.
 I know, baby.
 You'd dig it the most.
 But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?
 - What?
 - It's the little differences.
 I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here - but it's just there, it's a little different.
 - Example.
 You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.
 And I don't mean just like no paper cup.
 I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.
 And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's.
 You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?
 They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?
 They got the metric system.
 They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.
 - What do they call it?
 - They call it a Royale with Cheese.
 - Royale with Cheese.
 - That's right.
 What do they call a Big Mac?
 Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.
 Le Big Mac.
 What do they call a Whopper?
 I don't know.
 I didn't go into Burger King.
 You know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?
 What?
 - Mayonnaise.
 - Goddamn!
 I seen 'em do it, man.
 They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.
 Yuck.
 We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.
 - How many up there?
 - Three or four.
 - That's countin' our guy?
 - Not sure.
 So that means that it could be up to five guys up there?
 - It's possible.
 - We should have fuckin' shotguns.
 - What's her name?
 - Mia.
 - Mia.
 How did Marsellus and her meet?
 - I don't know.
 However people meet people.
 She used to be a actress.
 Oh, really?
 She do anything I'd have seen?
 I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.
 Pilot?
 What's a pilot?
 - Well, you know the shows on TV?
 - I don't watch TV.
 Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television and on this invention they show shows, right?
 Yeah.
 The way they pick TV shows is they make one show.
 That show's called a pilot.
 Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows.
 Some get chosen and become television programs.
 Some don't, become nothin'.
 She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.
 You remember Antwan Rockamora?
 Half-black, half-Samoan.
 Used to call him '
"Tony Rocky Horror.

" Yeah, maybe.
 Fat, right?
 I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.
 He got a weight problem.
 I mean, what's a nigger gonna do?
 He's Samoan.
 I think I know who you mean.
 What about him?
 Marsellus fucked him up good.
 Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.
 - So what he'd do?
 Fuck her?
 - No, no, no, no, no.
 Nothin' that bad.
 - Well, then what then?
 - He gave her a foot massage.
 A foot massage?
 That's it?
 Then what'd Marsellus do?
 Sent a couple cats over to his place.
 They took him out on his patio.
 Threw his ass over the balcony.
 Nigger fell four stories.
 He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.
 Nigger fell through that.
 Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment.
 That's a damn shame.
 But still, you play with matches, you get burned.
 What do you mean?
 You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.
 You don't think he overreacted?
 Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.
 It was a foot massage.
 A foot massage is nothin'.
 I give my mother a foot massage.
 It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.
 I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out?
 No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.
 Stop right there.
 Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.
 - It's not.
 It's the same ballpark.
 - Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.
 Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine.
 But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.
 - Foot massages don't mean shit!
 - Have you ever given a foot massage?
 Don't be tellin' me about foot massages.
 I'm the foot fuckin' master.
 You given a lot of them?
 Shit, yeah!
 Got my technique down and everything.
 I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.
 Would you give a guy a foot massage?
 Fuck you.
 - You give 'em a lot?
 - Fuck you.
 You know, I'm kind of tired.
 I could use a foot massage.
 Yo, yo, yo, man.
 You best back off.
 I'm gettin' a little pissed here.
 - This is the door.
 - Yeah, it is.
 What time you got?
 7:22 in the a.
m.
 No, it ain't quite time yet.
 Come on.
 Let's hang back.
 Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right.
 Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.
 I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothin'.
 I'm sayin' it does.
 Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.
 We act like they don't, but they do.
 That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.
 There's a sensuous thing goin' on where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it.
 Fuckin' Marsellus knew it.
 And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.
 That's his fuckin' wife, man.
 This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.
 You know what I'm sayin'?
 It's an interestin' point.
 Come on.
 Let's get into character.
 - What's her name again?
 - Mia.
 - Mia.
 - Why you so interested in big man's wife?
 He's goin' out of town, Florida.
 And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.
 - Take care of her?
 - No, man.
 Just take her out.
 Show her a good time.
 Make sure she don't get lonely.
 You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?
 It is not a date.
 It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.
 It's just good company, that's all.
 It's not a date.
 It's definitely not a date.
 Hey, kids.
 How you boys doin'?
 Hey, keep chillin'.
 You know who we are?
 We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace.
 You do remember your business partner, don't you?
 Now, let me take a wild guess here.
 - You're Brett, right?
 - Yeah.
 I thought so.
 You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?
 Yeah, I remember.
 Good.
 Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast.
 Sorry about that.
 Whatcha havin'?
 Hamburgers.
 Hamburgers!
 The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.
 What kind of hamburgers?
 - Cheeseburgers.
 - No, no, no.
 Where'd you get 'em?
 McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box?
 - Where?
 - Big Kahuna Burger.
 Big Kahuna Burger!
 That's that Hawaiian burger joint.
 I hear they got some tasty burgers.
 I ain't never had one myself.
 How are they?
 - They're good.
 - You mind if I try one of yours?
 - This is yours here, right?
 - Yeah.
 This is a tasty burger!
 Vincent!
 You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?
 - Want a bite?
 They're real tasty.
 - I ain't hungry.
 Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.
 Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.
 But I do love the taste of a good burger.
 You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?
 - No.
 - Tell 'em, Vincent.
 - A Royale with Cheese.
 - A Royale with Cheese.
 You know why they call it that?
 Because of the metric system?
 Check out the big brain on Brett!
 You're a smart motherfucker.
 That's right.
 The metric system.
 - What's in this?
 - Sprite.
 Sprite.
 Good.
 You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?
 Go right ahead.
 That hit the spot.
 You.
 Flock of Seagulls.
 You know why we're here?
 Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid at.
 It's over I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing!
 You were sayin'?
 It's in the cupboard.
 No, the one by your knees.
 We happy?
 Vincent?
 - We happy?
 - Yeah, we happy.
 Look, I'm sorry.
 I didn't get your name.
 I got yours.
 Vincent.
 Right?
 But I never got yours.
 My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.
 No, no, no.
 I just want you to know how I just want you to know how sorry we are that things got so fucked up with us and Mr.
 Wallace.
 We got into this thing with the best intentions.
 Really.
 I never- Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?
 I didn't mean to do that.
 Please.
 Continue.
 You were saying something about
"
"best intentions.

" What's the matter?
 Oh, you were finished!
 Oh, well, allow me to retort.
 What does Marsellus Wallace look like?
 What?
 - What country you from?
 - What?

"What
" ain't no country I ever heard of.
 They speak English in What?
 What?
 - English, Motherfucker!
 Do you speak it?
 - Yes!
 - Then you know what I'm sayin'!
 - Yes.
 Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!
 - What?
 I- - Say '
"what
" again!
 Say
"what
" again!
 I dare ya!
 I double dare you, motherfucker!
 - Say
"
"what
" one more goddamn time!
 - He's black.
 - Go on!
 - He's bald!
 - Does he look like a bitch?
 - What?
 Does he look like a bitch?
 No!
 Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?
 - I didn't.
 - Yes, you did.
 Yes, you did, Brett!
 - You tried to fuck him.
 - No, no.
 But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs.
 Wallace.
 - You read the Bible, Brett?
 - Yes!
 Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
 Sort of fits this occasion.
 Ezekiel 25:17.

"The path of the righteous man
" is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
 Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers!
 And you will know my name is the Lord
"when I lay my vengeance upon thee!

" I think you gonna find, when all this shit is over and done I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.
 The thing is, Butch right now you got ability.
 But painful as it may be, ability don't last.
 And your days are just about over.
 Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life.
 But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about.
 You see, this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.
 Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.
 If you mean it turns to Vinegar it does.
 If you mean it gets better with age it don't.
 Besides, Butch how many fights you think you got in you anyway?
 Two?
 Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.
 You came close, but you never made it.
 And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.
 You my nigger?
 Certainly appears so.
 The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.
 That's pride fuckin' with you.
 Fuck pride!
 Pride only hurts.
 It never helps.
 You fight through that shit.
 'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean you gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right.

" I got no problem with that, Mr.
 Wallace.
 In the fifth, your ass goes down.
 Say it.
 In the fifth, my ass goes down.
 Yo, Vincent Vega.
 Our man in Amsterdam.
 Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood.
 Get your asses on in here.
 Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes?
 You don't even want to know.
 Where's the big man?
 The big man's right over there takin' care of some business.
 Why don't you hang back a second or two.
 You see the white boy leave, just go on over.
 How ya been?
 I been doin' pretty good.
 How 'bout yourself?
 All right.
 So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.
 At Marsellus's request.
 - Have you met Mia?
 - Not yet.
 What's so fuckin' funny?
 - Not a goddamn thing.
 - I got to piss.
 Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right?
 It's the big man's wife.
 I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.
 Hey, my name's Paul, and this shit's between y'all.
 Then what'd you fuckin' ask me about it for?
 Asshole.
 - Gimme a pack of Red Apples.
 - Filters?
 No.
 - You lookin' at somethin', friend?
 - You ain't my friend, palooka.
 - What was that?
 - I think you heard me just fine, punchy.
 Vincent Vega's in the house?
 My nigger, get your ass over here.
 - What's up?
 - Man, I'm really sorry.
 You shouldn't worry about it.
 Pack of Red Apples.
 $1 .
40.
 And some matches.
 Thanks.
 It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis.
 I'll lend it to you.
 It's a great book on piercing.
 That gun to pierce your ears, they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they?
 Forget that gun.
 That guns goes against the entire idea behind piercing.
 All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.
 Five in each ear, one through the nipple of my left breast two in my right nostril, one in my left eyebrow one in my belly, one in my lip, one in my clit - and I wear a stud in my tongue.
 - Excuse me.
 I was just curious but why would you wear a stud in your tongue?
 Sex thing.
 Helps fellatio.
 Vincenzo.
 Step in my office.
 This is Panda from Mexico.
 Very good stuff.
 Now, that's Bava.
 Different, but equally good.
 And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany.
 Now, the first two are the same.
 300 a gram.
 Those are friend prices.
 But this one is a little more expensive.
 This is 500 a gram.
 But, when you shoot it, you will know where that extra money went.
 There's nothing wrong with these two.
 This is real, real, real good shit.
 But this one is a fuckin' madman.
 Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.
 Am I a nigger?
 Are we in Inglewood?
 No.
 You're in my home.
 Now, white people who know the difference between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.
 Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit - any old day of the fuckin' week.
 - That's a bold statement.
 This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.
 This is a seller's market.
 Coke is fuckin' dead as dead.
 Heroin, it's comin' back in a big fuckin' way.
 - All right.
 Gimme three grams of madman.
 - Okay.
 Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll come back and buy another thousand.
 I just hope that I still have some left for ya but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash.
 That is what a nice guy I am.
 - I'm outta balloons.
 Is a baggie all right?
 - Yeah, that's cool.
 All right.
 I'll just get one for ya.
 Honey, will you get me some baggies and twistix from the kitchen?
 Okay.
 Hey, what do you think about Trudi?
 She ain't got a boyfriend.
 - You wanna hang out and get high?
 - Which one's Trudi?
 - The one with all the shit in her face?
 - No, that's Jody.
 That's my wife.
 - I'm sorry, man.
 - Thank you.
 - No, I can't.
 I gotta be someplace.
 - All right, no problemo I'll take a rain check.
 Thank you, Jody.
 Still got your Malibu?
 Oh, man, you know what some fucker did the other day?
 - What?
 - Fuckin' keyed it.
 - Oh, man, that's fucked up.
 - Tell me about it.
 I had it in storage for three years.
 It was out five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.
 They should be fuckin' killed, man.
 No trial, no jury, straight to execution.
 I wish I could've caught him doin' it.
 I'd have given anything to catch that asshole.
 It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him.
 What a fucker!
 What's more chicken-shit than fuckin' with a man's automobile?
 - Don't fuck with another man's Vehicle.
 - You don't do it.
 - It's just against the rules.
 - Thank you.
 Thank you.
 - Mind if I shoot up here?
 - Hey, mi casa es su casa.

 Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was.
 He was.
 - Lord he knows he was - Yes, he was.
 How well I remember.
 The look that was in his eyes.
 Stealing kisses from me on the sly.
 Taking time to make time.
 Telling me that he's all mine.
 Learning from each other's knowin'.
 Looking to see how much we've grown.
 And the only one who could ever reach me.
 Was the son of a preacher man.
 The only boy who could ever teach me.
 Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was.
 - Was, was - He was.
 Oh, yes, he was.

 An Elvis man should love it.

 I'll have the Durward Kirby burger, bloody.
 And a five-dollar shake.
 How do you want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?
 - Martin and Lewis.
 - Did you just order a five-dollar shake?
 - That's a shake?
 That's milk and ice cream?
 - Last I heard.
 That's five dollars?
 You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?
 - No.
 - Just checking.
 I'll be right back with your drinks.
 To lonesome town.
 To cry my troubles away.
 Could you roll me one of those, cowboy?
 You can have this one, cowgirl.
 Thanks.
 The streets are filled with regret.
 Think nothin' of it.
 Lay me down in lonesome town.
 - I can learn to forget - So Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.
 - Sure did.
 - How long were you there?
 Just over three years.
 I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.
 No kiddin'?
 I didn't know that.
 Why would you?
 I heard you did a pilot.
 That was my 15 minutes.
 What was it?
 It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five.
 - What?
 - Fox Force Five.
 Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.
 Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.
 And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us.
 There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal.
 She was the leader.
 The Japanese fox was a Kung Fu master.
 The black girl was a demolition expert.
 French Fox's specialty was sex.
 What was your specialty?
 Knives.
 The character I played, Raven McCoy her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.
 According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.
 And she knew a zillion old jokes.
 Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.
 And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick where every show I would've told another joke.
 You know any of them old jokes?
 Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show.
 - Tell me.
 - It's corny.
 Don't be that way.
 Tell me.
 No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.
 You'd be embarr-You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me?
 - I promise I won't laugh.
 - That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.
 That's not what I meant.
 You know it.
 Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.
 What a gyp.
 Martin and Lewis.
 Vanilla coke.
 Yummy.
 You think I could have a sip of that?
 Be my guest.
 I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.
 You can use my straw.
 I don't have cooties.
 - Yeah, but maybe I do.
 - Cooties I can handle.
 All right.
 Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake!
 Told ya.
 I don't know if it was worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.
 Don't you hate that?
 Hate what?
 Uncomfortable silences.
 Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?
 I don't know.
 That's a good question.
 That's when you know you found somebody really special.
 When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.
 Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad.
 We just met each other.
 I'll tell you what.
 I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.
 You sit here and think of something to say.
 I'll do that.
 Okay.
 I said goddamn!
 Goddamn!
 Goddamn.
 I need some hair spray.
 Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom to find your food waiting for you?
 We're lucky we got anything at all.
 I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.
 Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.
 - Which one?
 There's two Monroes.
 - No, there's not.
 That is Marilyn Monroe.
 That is Mamie Van Doren.
 I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off.
 - Pretty smart.
 - Yeah.
 I got my moments.
 So did you think of somethin' to say?
 Actually, I did.
 However you seem like a really nice person, and I I don't want to offend you.
 This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.
 This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.
 Well, well, I do.
 I do.
 - But you have to promise not to be offended.
 - No, no.
 You can't promise somethin' like that.
 I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.
 You can ask me what you're gonna ask me and my natural response could be to get offended.
 Then through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise.
 - Let's just forget it.
 - That's an impossibility.
 Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.
 - Is that a fact?
 - And besides isn't it more exciting when you don't have permission?
 All right, all right.
 Well, here goes.
 What did you think about what happened to Antwan?
 - Who's Antwan?
 - Tony Rocky Horror.
 You know him.
 He fell out of a window.
 Well, that is one way to say it.
 Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.
 Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.
 Yet, even another way is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.
 - Is that a fact?
 - No.
 No, it's not a fact.
 It's just what I heard.
 That's just what I heard.
 - Who told you?
 - They.

"They
" talk a lot, don't they?
 They certainly do.
 They certainly do.
 Don't be shy, Vincent.
 What else did
"
"they
" say?
 I'm not shy.
 Did it involve the '
"F
" word?
 No, no, no, no, no.
 They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.
 - And?
 - And nothin'.
 That's it.
 You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window for giving me a foot massage?
 And you believe that?
 Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.
 Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?
 No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.
 I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.
 A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.
 A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.
 But did it happen?
 Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it at my wedding.
 Really?
 Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window except Marsellus and Tony.
 When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.
 Ladies and gentlemen.
 Now the moment you've all been waiting for.
 The world-famous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.
 Now, this is where one lucky couple will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.
 Now, who will be our first contestants?
 - Right here!
 - All right!
 - I wanna dance.
 - No, no, no, no, no.
 No, no, no, no, no.
 I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted.
 Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.
 - So dance good.
 - All right.
 You asked for it.
 Let's hear it for our first contestants.
 Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening.
 Young lady, what is your name?
 Mrs.
 Mia Wallace.
 And how 'bout your fella here?
 Vincent Vega.
 All right, let's see what you can do.
 Take it away!
 - Go for it.
 - Come on!
 It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well.
 You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle.
 And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell.
 C'estlavie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell.
 They furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebucks sale.
 The 'cooleradorwas crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale.
 But when Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well.
 C'estlavie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell.
 They had a hi-fi phono and boy did they let it blast.
 Seven hundred little records all rock, rhythm and jazz.
 But when the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell.
 C'estlavie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell.
 They had a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well.
 You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle.
 Is that what you call an uncomfortable silence?
 I don't know what you call that.
 Drinks!
 Music!
 I'm gonna take a piss.
 That's a little bit more information than I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.
 Girl.
 Bomp, bomp, bom.
 You'll be a woman soon.
 I love you so much Can't count all the ways.
 I'd die for you, girl and all they can say is.

 What I'm gonna find.
 Don't let them make up your mind.
 Don't you know, girl.

 One drink, and that's it.
 Don't be rude.
 Drink your drink, but do it quickly.
 Say good night and go home.
 You'll be a woman soon.
 Soon.
 You'll need a man.
 I've been misunderstood for all of my life.
 But what they're sayin', girl it cuts like a knife.
 The boy's no good.
 Well, I've finally have found what I been lookin' for.
 But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure.
 Sure they would.
 Baby, I've done all I could.
 You see, this is a moral test of oneself.
 Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.
 Because being loyal is very important.
 You never get tired of putting me down and I never know when I come around.
 What I'm gonna find.
 Don't let them make up your mind.
 Don't you know, girl.
 You'll be a woman soon.
 Please.

 Girl.
 You'll be a woman soon.
 Please.
 Come take my hand.
 - Hello.
 - Girl.
 So, you're gonna go out there and you're gonna say '
"Good night.
 I've had a very lovely evening.

" Walk out the door, get in the car, go home, jerk off and that's all you gonna do.
 Now it's up to you, girl.
 You'll be a woman soon.
 Please.
 Come take my hand.
 Girl.
 You'll be a woman soon.

 You'll need a man.
 All right, Mia.
 So listen, I gotta go, all right?
 Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.
 You fu-Oh, Jesus Christ!
 Oh, fuck me.
 Fuck me!
 Oh-Come on, girl.
 We're gettin' outta here.
 We gotta walk now.
 Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!
 Fuck!
 Answer.
 Have you got the ring?
 - Why, certainly.
 - Join hands, you two lovebirds.
 Please!
 Please!
 Yes, yes.
 Hold hands, you lovebirds.
 Fuck you, Lance!
 Answer!
 Now what do you say?
 I give up!
 I'll marry you!
 Lance!
 The goddamn phone's ringing!
 I can hear it.
 I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call here this late!
 Yeah, I told them.
 And that is exactly what I'm going to tell this fucking asshole right now.
 - Don't you dare strike me!
 - Hello.
 Lance!
 Vincent.
 I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.
 I'm coming to your house.
 Hold your horses, man.
 What's the problem?
 - I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.
D.
in' on me!
 - Well, don't bring her here!
 I'm not even joking with you!
 Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!
 - No choice.
 - She's O.
D.
in'?
 - She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!
 - Just dandy.
 Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet, take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.
 - Negative!
 - This is not my fuckin' problem, man!
 You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this!
 Are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?
 I don't know you.
 Who is this?
 Don't come here!
 I'm hanging up the phone!
 Prank caller!
 Prank caller!
 What the hell was that?
 Have you lost your fucking mind?
 You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!
 Lance, help me.
 - You crashed your car into my fucking house!
 - Grab her feet.
 Are you deaf?
 You are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house!
 This
"fucked-up bitch
" is Marsellus Wallace's wife.
 - Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is?
 - Yeah.
 If she croaks on me, I am a fucking grease spot!
 I will be forced to tell him that you did not help and let her die on your lawn.
 Now, come on, help me, help me.
 Pick her up.
 Shit.
 Lance!
 Shit.
 It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.
 What the fuck's going on out here?
 Who's she?
 Go to the fridge and get the thing with the adrenaline shot.
 - What's wrong with her?
 - She's O.
D.
ing!
 - Get her outta here!
 - Get the shot!
 - Fuck you!
 Fuck you too!
 - What a fuckin' bitch.
 Just keep talking to her, all right?
 She's gettin' the shot.
 I'm going to go get my little black medical book.
 What the fuck you need a medical book for?
 I've never had to give an adrenaline shot before!
 I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers!
 My friends can handle their highs!
 - Get the shot!
 - I am, if you'll let me!
 - I ain't stopping you!
 - Stop talking to me.
 Start talking to her!
 - Get the shot!
 - All right!
 - Hurry up.
 We're losing her!
 - I'm looking as fast as I can!
 What's he looking for?
 - I don't know.
 Some book.
 - What are you looking for?
 - A little black medical book.
 - What are you looking for?
 My little black medical book!
 It's like a textbook they give to nurses.
 - I never saw no medical book.
 - Trust me.
 I have one.
 If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot?
 I don't know!
 Stop bothering me!
 While you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.
 You're never gonna find anything in this mess!
 I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up!
 Lance, get in here!
 - Right?
 - Get the fuck outta my way.
 Pig.
 Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.
 While I'm doing this, you take off her shirt and find her heart.
 - Does it gotta be exact?
 - Yeah, it's gotta be exact.
 We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.
 I don't know exactly where her heart is.
 I think it's right here.
 - That's it.
 - This it?
 All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.
 - You got it?
 - What?
 A magic marker.
 A felt pen!
 A fuckin' black magic marker!
 Christ.
 - Come on, man.
 Hurry up!
 - Fuck!
 Okay, okay.
 Okay.
 I think it's ready.
 - Hurry up, man.
 - I'll tell you what to do.
 - You're gonna give her the shot.
 - No, you're gonna give her the shot.
 I ain't giving her the shot.
 I never done this before.
 I never done this either!
 I ain't starting now!
 You brought her here.
 You give her the shot.
 The day I bring an O.
D.
ing bitch to your house, then I give her the shot.
 - Give her the shot.
 - Give it to me.
 Give me that.
 All right, tell me what to do.
 Okay, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart.
 But she's got a breastplate- you gotta pierce through that.
 You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.
 - I gotta stab her three times?
 - No, just stab her once!
 But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.
 Once you do that, you press down on the plunger.
 - Okay.
 Then what happens?
 - Kinda curious about that myself.
 This ain't no fuckin' joke!
 Am I gonna kill her?
 She's supposed to come out of it like that.
 It's- All right, count to three.
 - All right.
 Ready?
 - One.
 Two.
 Three!
 If you're all right, then say something.
 Something.
 That was fuckin' trippy.
 - Ohh.
 - Oh, man.
 Mia.
 Mia.
 What's- What's your thoughts on-on- on how to handle this?
 What's yours?
 Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident.
 If Marsellus knew about this incident, I'd be in as much trouble as you.
 I seriously doubt that.
 I can keep a secret if you can.
 Shake on it?
 Mum's the word?
 Cool.
 Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.
 Vincent.
 Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke?
 Sure.
 Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.
 No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.
 But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.
 - I can't wait.
 - Okay.
 Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.
 Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato and Baby Tomato.
 Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry.
 Goes back and squishes him and says,
"'Ketchup.

" Ketchup.
 See you around.
 Oh, that paddlefoot.
 He funny, silly dog.
 He think totem pole alive!
 He Arctic tenderfoot!
 That totem pole been here forever!
 Butch?
 One more thing, and we'll start for- - Butch, stop watching TV for a second.
 - Yeah?
 - You've got a special Visitor.
 - Stand up.
 Stand up.
 Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a POW camp?
 Well, this here is Captain Koons.
 He was in the POW camp with Daddy.
 Hello, little man.
 Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.
 See, I was a good friend of your dad's.
 We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together, over five years.
 Hopefully you'll never have to experience this yourself but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were for as long as we were you take on certain responsibilities of the other.
 If it'd been me who'd not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.
 But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you.
 Butch I got something for ya.
 This watch I got here was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the First World War.
 It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee.
 Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.
 Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches.
 It was bought by private Doughboy Erine Coolidge on the day he set sail for Paris.
 This was your great-grandfather's war watch and he wore it every day he was in that war, and when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.
 This time they called it World War II.
 Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.
 Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's.
 Dane was a Marine, and he was killed along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island.
 Your granddad was facing death.
 He knew it.
 None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive so three days before the Japanese took the island your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki a man he'd never met before in his life to deliver to his infant son who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.
 Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word.
 After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.
 This watch.
 This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.
 He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp.
 He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch it'd be confiscated, taken away.
 The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright.
 He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something-his ass.
 Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.
 Then he died of dysentery- He give me the watch.
 I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.
 Then after seven years, I was sent home to my family and now little man, I give the watch to you.
 It's time, Butch.
 In the lightweight division in the right corner wearing the blue trunks weighing 210 pounds Floyd Ray Wilson!
 It's official.
 It's official.
 Wilson is dead!
 Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest and hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen.
 Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a Victorious boxer leave the ring.
 - Do you think he knew Wilson was dead?
 - My guess would be yes.
 I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.
 I think any man would've left the ring that fast.
 Do you feel this tragedy is gonna affect the world of boxing?
 A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.
 It's of paramount importance, during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the WBA remain- Man, you know I didn't-.
 - Marsellus.
 - No, it wasn't.
 I didn't do it.
 I didn't do it.
 - How you doing?
 - Great.
 I never thanked you for dinner.
 - What you got?
 - He booked.
 - His trainer?
 - Says he don't know nothin'.
 I believe him.
 - I think Butch surprised his ass same as us.
 - No, we don't wanna think.
 We wanna know.
 Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.
 We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.
 Butch's search-how do you want it done?
 I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.
 If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice - ready to pop a cap in his ass.
 - I will take care of it.
 Mister.
 - Hey, mister.
 - What?
 You were in that fight, the fight on the radio.
 - You're the fighter?
 - Whatever gave you that idea?
 No, come on.
 You're him.
 I know you're him.
 Tell me you're him.
 I'm him.
 You killed the other boxing man.
 He's dead?
 The radio said he was dead.
 Sorry about that, Floyd.
 What does it feel like?
 What does what feel like?
 Killing a man.
 Beating another man to death with your bare hands.
 What are you, a weirdo?
 No.
 It is a subject I have much interest in.
 You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.
 So?
 What does it feel like to kill a man?
 I'll tell you what.
 Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there and I'll tell you all about it.
 So, Esmarelda Villa Lobos-is that Mexican?
 The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.
 - That's some handle you got there, honey.
 - Thank you.
 And what is your name?
 Butch.
 What does it mean?
 I'm an American, honey.
 Our names don't mean shit.
 So, moving right along, Esmarelda what is it you want to know?
 - I want to know what it feels like to kill a man.
 - I couldn't tell ya.
 I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.
 Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it?
 I don't feel the least bit bad about it.
 What the fuck'd I tell ya?
 As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof.
 I know.
 I know.
 Unbelievable.
 Hey, fuck him, Scotty.
 If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive.
 If he never laced up his gloves which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.
 Yeah, well, who gives a fuck?
 It's over now.
 Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr.
 Floyd.
 Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr.
 Butch.
 How many bookies did you lay it around on?
 All eight?
 How long to collect?
 So you'll have it all by tomorrow night?
 No, I understand.
 A few stragglers aside.
 Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.
 That is great news, man.
 Yeah.
 No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.
 It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.
 Okay, my brother.
 You're right.
 You're goddamn right.
 All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time.
 Cool, brother.
 $45.
60.
 And here's a little something for the effort.
 Now if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say?
 The truth.
 Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans.
 Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.
 Buenas noches, Butch.
 Whew.
 Keep the light off.
 - Is that better, sugar pop?
 - Oui.
 Hard day at the office?
 Pretty hard.
 Got in a fight.
 Poor baby.
 Can you make spoons?
 You know what?
 I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.
 - I'm stinkin' like a dog over here.
 - I like the way you stink.
 Let me take this jacket off.
 - I was looking at myself in the mirror.
 - Uh-huh.
 I wish I had a pot.
 You were looking at yourself in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?
 A pot.
 A pot belly.
 Pot bellies are sexy.
 Well, you should be happy 'cause you have one.
 Shut up, fatso.
 I don't have a pot.
 I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did
"'Lucky Star.

" It's not the same thing.
 I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.
 The difference is huge.
 Would you like it if I had a pot belly?
 No.
 Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.
 But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.
 The rest of you is normal-normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.
 If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.
 You think men would find that attractive?
 I don't give a damn what men find attractive.
 It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye is seldom the same.
 If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it.
 - You'd punch me in the belly?
 - Right in the belly.
 Ohh!
 I'd smother you!
 I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe!
 - You'd do that?
 - Yeah.
 - Promise?
 - Yeah.
 Did you get everything?
 - Yes, I did.
 - Good job, sugar pop.
 Did everything go as planned?
 You didn't listen to the-Ow!
 You didn't listen to the radio?
 I never listen to your fights.
 Were you the winner?
 I won, all right.
 - Are you still retiring?
 - Sure am.
 So it all worked out in the finish.
 We're not at the finish yet, baby.
 We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?
 If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?
 But they won't find us, will they?
 Do you still want me to go with you?
 I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance.
 It's- Say it.
 Fabienne, I want you to be with me.
 - Forever?
 - Forever and ever.
 Do you love me?
 Very, very much.
 - Butch.
 - Yes?
 Will you give me oral pleasure?
 Will you kiss it?
 But you first.
 - Okay.
 - Okay.
 Butch.
 I think I cracked a rib.
 - Giving me oral pleasure?
 - No, retard, from the fight.
 - Don't call me retard.
 - My name is Fabby.
 - My name is Fabienne!
 - Stop it.
 - Stop it!
 - My name is Fabi-.
 Shut up, fuckhead!
 I hate that mongoloid Voice.
 Okay, okay.
 Sorry, sorry, sorry.
 I take it back.
 Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip?
 Oh, I like that.
 I like being called a tulip.
 Tulip is much better than mongoloid.
 I didn't call you a mongoloid.
 I called you a retard.
 And I took it back.
 Butch?
 Yes, lemon pie?
 - Where are we going to go?
 - Well, I'm not sure yet.
 Wherever you want.
 We're gonna get a lot of money from this but it ain't gonna be the kind of money that we can live like hogs in the fat house forever.
 I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific.
 Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there.
 - If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora?
 - You betcha.
 And if after a while you didn't dig that, we could go someplace else.
 Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.
 But I do not speak Spanish.
 Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.
 Besides, Mexican's easy.
 - What does that mean?
 - Where is the shoe store?
 Spit, please.
 Excellent pronunciation.
 You'll be my little mamacita in no time.
 - What time is it?
 - What time is it?
 Time for bed.
 Sweet dreams, jellybean.
 Butch?
 Never mind.
 Merde!
 You startled me.
 Did you have a bad dream?
 What is this you're watching?
 A motorcycle movie.
 I'm not sure the name.
 - Are you watching it?
 - In a way.
 It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war.
 What was it about?
 How should I know?
 You were the one watching it.
 - No, imbecile, what was your dream about?
 - I don't know.
 I don't remember.
 It's really rare that I remember my dreams.
 Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning.
 Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast.
 One more kiss and I'll get up.
 - Satisfied?
 - Yep.
 Get up, lazy bones!
 God.
 - What time is it?
 - Almost 9:00 in the morning.
 - What time does our train arrive?
 - 11:00.
 - You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast?
 - What, lemon pie?
 I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup eggs over easy and five sausages.
 Anything to drink with that?
 Wow, that looks nice.
 To drink-a tall glass of orange juice and a black cup of coffee.
 - After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie.
 - Pie for breakfast?
 Any time of the day is a good time for pie.
 Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.
 And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.
 Where's my watch?
 It's there.
 - No, it's not.
 - Have you looked?
 Yes, I've fuckin' looked.
 What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?
 You sure you got it?
 Yes.
 Bedside table drawer.
 - On the little kangaroo?
 - Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.
 Yeah, well, it's not here now.
 Well, it should be.
 Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's not here now!
 So where the fuck is it?
 Fabienne, where's my father's fucking watch?
 Do you have any idea what he had to go through to get me that watch?
 I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot.
 All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you not to forget the fucking watch!
 Now think.
 - Did you get it?
 - I believe so.
 You believe so?
 What the fuck does that mean?
 You either did or didn't get it.
 Then I did.
 Are you sure?
 No.
 Fuck!
 Fuck!
 Fuck!
 Motherfucker!
 Motherfuckin'-.
 Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are?
 No!
 It's not your fault.
 You left it at the apartment.
 If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault.
 I had you bring a bunch of stuff.
 I reminded you about it but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me.
 I fall I gave a fuck about was the watch, I shoulda told you that.
 You're not a mind reader.
 Are you?
 I'm sorry.
 Don't be.
 Just means I can't have breakfast with you.
 Why does it mean that?
 Because I gotta go back to my apartment and get my watch.
 Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?
 Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.
 If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, then I'll split.
 I saw your watch.
 I thought I brought it.
 I'm so sorry.
 Here's some money.
 Go out and get those pancakes.
 Have a nice breakfast.
 I'll take your Honda.
 I'll be back before you can say blueberry pie.
 Blueberry pie.
 Maybe not that fast.
 - But pretty fast.
 Okay?
 - Okay.
 - Bye.
 - Bye.
 Shit!
 Of all the fuckin' things she could fuckin' forget she forgets my father's watch!
 I specifically reminded her- Bedside table, on the kangaroo.
 I said the words:
"Don't forget my father's watch.

" Visit the Jackrabbit Slim's nearest you Lookin' good, Butch.
 If I were walkin' in your shoes.
 I wouldn't worry much.
 Countin' flowers on the wall That don't bother me at all.
 Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of51.
 That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.
 They keep underestimatin' ya.
 Now don't tell me.
 Countin' flowers on the wall.
 That don't bother me at all.
 Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of51.
 Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo.
 Now don't tell me.
 I've nothin' to do.
 It's good to see you I must go.
 I know I look a fright.
 - Anyway my eyes - Motherfucker.
 - Are not accustomed- - Uhh!
 - Do you think he's dead?
 - He's dead.
 - Oh, my God.
 - He's dead.
 If you need someone to go to court, I'll be glad to help.
 That guy was a drunken maniac.
 He hit you, then he crashed into that car.
 - Who?
 - Him.
 I'll be damned.
 I'm shot!
 Sally!
 Sally!
 Motherfucker!
 - Can I help you with somethin'?
 - Shut the fuck up.
 Now you just wait a goddamn minute, now!
 What the fuck you up to?
 Come here, motherfucker!
 You feel that sting, huh, big boy?
 That's pride fuckin' with you, see?
 You gotta fight through that shit!
 - You'd better kill me- - Yeah, somebody's gonna get killed.
 Somebody's gonna get their motherfuckin' head blown to-.
 Hold it right there, goddamn it.
 - This ain't none of your business, mister.
 - I'm makin' it my business.
 - Toss the weapon.
 - You don't understand, man.
 Toss the weapon.
 It's time.
 - To find love - Take your foot off the nigger.
 Put your hand behind your head approach the counter right now.
 This motherfucker's trying to kill me.
 Shut up.
 Keep comin'.
 Come on.
 If love.
 Is shelter.
 Zed.
 Maynard.
 Yeah, the spider just caught a couple flies.
 Whoa, my angel.
 Down to you.
 Nobody kills anybody in my place of business except me or Zed.
 That's Zed.
 - I thought you said you waited for me.
 - I did.
 Then how come they're all beat up?
 They did that to each other, man.
 They came in fightin'.
 Now, this 'un right here - he was gonna shoot that one.
 - Is that right?
 You gonna shoot him, boy?
 Hey, is Grace all right out front?
 - Yeah.
 It ain't Tuesday, is it?
 - No, it's Thursday.
 She oughta be fine.
 Well, bring out the gimp.
 I think the gimp's sleepin'.
 Then I guess you'll just have to go wake him up now, won't you?
 Get up.
 Get down.
 Which one of 'em you wanna do first?
 I ain't for sure yet.
 Eenie-meenie-minie-mo catch a nigger by his toe.
 If he hollers, let him go.
 Eenie-meenie-minie-mo.
 My mother said pick the perfect one and you are it.
 - Guess that means you, big boy.
 - Fuck you!
 You wanna do it in here?
 No, let's take him back to Russell's old room.
 Sounds good to me.
 You keep an eye on this 'un.
 Yeah!
 Now!
 Go!
 Come on, motherfucker!
 Now, motherfucker!
 Come on!
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 - Ohh!
 - Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Yeee!
 Yeeee-hah!
 Yeah!
 Come on!
 Get down there!
 Do it!
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Shut the fuck up!
 Fuck him!
 Come on!
 Fuck him.
 Yeah.
 You want that gun, don't ya, Zed?
 Go ahead and pick it up.
 Go ahead, pick it up.
 Come on-Thatta boy!
 I want you to pick it up, Zed.
 Step aside, Butch.
 Fuck!
 You okay?
 No, man.
 I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.
 What now?
 Let me tell you what now.
 I'm gonna call a couple of hard, pipe-hittin' niggers to go to work on the homes here with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.
 You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy?
 I ain't through with you by a damn sight!
 I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.
 I meant what now between me and you.
 Oh, that what now.
 I tell you what now between me and you.
 There is no me and you.
 Not no more.
 So, are we cool?
 Yeah, we cool.
 Two things.
 Don't tell nobody about this.
 This shit is between me, you and Mr.

"'Soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain
" rapist here.
 It ain't nobody else's business.
 Two-.
 You leave town tonight.
 Right now.
 And when you gone, you stay gone or you be gone.
 You lost all your LA privileges.
 Deal?
 Deal.
 Get your ass outta here.
 Oh, shit.
 Fabienne!
 Fabienne!
 Come on, baby.
 Come on.
 Get your shit.
 We gotta go right now.
 I was so worried.
 What about our bags?
 Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.
 - Come on, I'll be downstairs.
 - Is everything well?
 - Just come on!
 No talking now!
 - Are we in danger?
 Come on, honey!
 Where did you get this motorcycle?
 It's not a motorcycle, baby.
 It's a chopper.
 Let's go.
 What happened to my Honda?
 I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda.
 Will you come on now, please?
 Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.
 You're hurt?
 No, no, I might've broken my nose.
 It's no biggie.
 Come on.
 Hop on.
 Baby, please, we-.
 Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road!
 Get on!
 Oh, baby, I'm sorry.
 Come here, come here.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.
 I didn't mean to worry you.
 Everything's fine.
 - How was your breakfast?
 - It was good.
 Did you get the blueberry pancakes?
 They didn't have blueberry; I had to get buttermilk.
 Are you sure you're okay?
 Since I left you, this has been, without a doubt the single weirdest fuckin' day of my life-I'll tell you all about it.
 Gotta go.
 Come on.
 Butch, whose motorcycle is this?
 - It's a chopper, baby.
 - Whose chopper is this?
 - Zed's.
 - Who's Zed?
 Zed's dead, baby.
 Zed's dead.
 Yes, you did, Brett!
 You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked by anybody except Mrs.
 Wallace.
 - Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die.
 - You read the Bible, Brett?
 - Yes!
 - Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
 Sorta fits the occasion.
 Ezekiel 25:17.

"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
" by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
 Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
 And you will know my name is the Lord
"when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

" I'm fucked.
 Oh, fuck.
 Oh, fuck.
 - Is he a friend of yours?
 - Oh, goddamn.
 Goddamn.
 Vincent, Marvin.
 Marvin, Vincent.
 Better tell him to shut up.
 He's gettin' on my nerves.
 Marvin.
 Marvin.
 Marvin!
 I'd knock that shit off if I was you.
 Die, you motherfuckers!
 Die!
 Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?
 Slip your mind?
 Did you forget that someone was in there with a goddamn hand cannon?
 You see the size of that gun he fired at us?
 It was bigger than him.
 We should be fuckin' dead, man.
 I know.
 We was lucky.
 No, no, no, no.
 That shit wasn't luck.
 Yeah, maybe.
 This was divine intervention.
 You know what divine intervention is?
 I think so.
 That means that God came down from heaven and stopped the bullets.
 That's right.
 That's exactly what it means.
 God came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.
 I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.
 Don't do that.
 Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!
 What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!
 Chill.
 This shit happens.
 Wrong!
 Wrong.
 This shit doesn't just happen.
 Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car or in a jailhouse with the cops?
 We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!
 What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!
 All right, it was a miracle.
 Can we go now?
 Let's go, nigger!
 Come on!
 Shit.
 You ever seen that show Cops?
 I was watching it one time and there was this cop on and he was talkin' about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy, right?
 He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened.
 He didn't hit nothin'.
 Okay?
 It was just him and this guy.
 I mean, you know, it's freaky, but it happens.
 You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.
 What the fuck does that mean?
 It means that's it for me.
 From here on in, you can consider my ass retired.
 - Jesus Christ.
 Goddamn it.
 - Don't blaspheme.
 - I said, don't do that!
 - Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?
 Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today-I'm through.
 - Why don't you tell him at the same time why?
 - Don't worry, I will.
 - And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off.
 - I don't give a damn if he does.
 Marvin, what do you make of all this?
 Man, I don't even have an opinion.
 You gotta have an opinion.
 You think God came down from heaven and stopped-.
 What the fuck's happenin'?
 - Shit, man!
 - Man!
 - Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face.
 - Why the fuck'd you do that?
 I didn't mean it.
 It was an accident.
 Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this- Chill out, man!
 It was an accident.
 We probably went over a bump or somethin'.
 The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.
 I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch.
 The gun went off.
 Look at this fuckin' mess!
 We're on a city street in broad daylight here!
 - I don't believe it!
 - Well, believe it now, motherfucker!
 We gotta get this car off the road.
 Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.
 - Just take it to a friendly place, that's all!
 - This is the Valley, Vincent.
 Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.
 - Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man!
 - Shit!
 - What you doing?
 - I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.
 - Where's Toluca Lake?
 - Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.
 If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do 'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.
 Jimmie, how you doin', man?
 It's Jules.
 Just listen up, man.
 Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.
 I need to use your garage for a couple hours.
 We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.
 He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.
 - If he does, what do we do?
 - We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls but I don't want it to reach that pitch- Jimmie's a friend.
 You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.
 Just tell him not to be abusive.
 He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.
 Put yourself in his position- It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.
 He wasn't expectin' this shit.
 We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.
 If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass.
 Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man?
 I was dryin' my hands!
 - You're supposed to wash 'em first!
 - You watched me wash 'em.
 - I watched you get 'em wet.
 - I was washin' 'em.
 This shit's hard to get off.
 Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.
 I used the same fuckin' soap you did and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!
 What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?
 It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man!
 Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right?
 You know I respect you and all.
 But just don't put me in this position, all right?
 All right.
 Fine.
 Fine.
 Ask me nice like that, no problem.
 Just go handle your friend.
 Go ahead.
 I don't care.
 Goddamn, Jimmie!
 This some serious gourmet shit.
 Me and Vincent would've been satisfied with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.
 Right?
 And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.
 - What flavor is this?
 - Knock it off, Julie.
 What?
 I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.
 I'm the one who buys it.
 I know how good it is.
 When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.
 I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.
 But you know what's on my mind right now?
 It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.
 It's the dead nigger in my garage.
 Jimmie, don't even worry- Don't tell me about anything.
 I wanna ask you a question.
 When you came pulling in here did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said,
"'Dead nigger storage
"?
 You know I ain't seen no-.
 Did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said,
"Dead nigger storage
"?
 No.
 I didn't.
 - You know why you didn't see that sign?
 - Why?
 'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!
 - We're not gonna store the motherfucker- - Don't you fuckin' realize that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?
 No marriage counselor.
 No trial separation.
 I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.
 Okay?
 And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!
 Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.
 Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.
 Don't fuckin'
"Jimmie
" me, Jules!
 Okay?
 Don't fuckin' '
"Jimmie
" me.
 There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife.
 Is there?
 Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half.
 The graveyard shift at the hospital.
 You gotta make some phone calls?
 You gotta call some people?
 Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here.
 That's Kool and the Gang.
 We don't wanna fuck your shit up.
 All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.
 You're fucking my shit up right now!
 You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.
 Do me that favor, all right?
 The phone is in my bedroom.
 I suggest you get going.
 Well, say she comes home.
 What do you think she'll do?
 Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.
 That ain't no kinda answer.
 I mean, you know, I don't.
 How much?
 A lot or a little?
 You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is.
 She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen doing a bunch of gangster shit there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do.
 Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.
 All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.
 I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs!
 All I want to hear from your ass is
"You ain't got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.
 Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly.

" You ain't got no problem, Jules.
 I'm on the motherfucker.
 Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.
 You sendin' the Wolf?
 Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?
 Shit, negro!
 That's all you had to say!
 She the hysterical type?
 When is she due?
 Give me the principals' names again.
 Place your bets.
 - Jules.
 - Cards, please.
 Vincent.
 Jimmie.
 Bonnie.
 It's 30 minutes away.
 I'll be there in 10.
 You're Jimmie, right?
 This is your house?
 - It sure is.
 - I'm Winston Wolf.
 I solve problems.
 - Good.
 We got one.
 - So I heard.
 May I come in?
 Yeah.
 Please do.
 You must be Jules.
 Which would make you Vincent.
 Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.
 If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking.
 Is that right, Jimmie?
 One hundred percent.
 Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.
m.
, correct?
 Uh-huh.
 I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.
 She wouldn't at that.
 That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty.
 Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage.
 Take me to it.
 - Jimmie.
 - Uh-huh.
 Do me a favor, will ya?
 Thought I smelled some coffee back there.
 - Would you make me a cup?
 - Yeah, sure.
 Oh, how do you take it?
 Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.
 About the car, is there anything I need to know?
 Does it stall?
 Does it smoke?
 Does it make a lot of noise?
 Is there gas in it?
 - Aside from how it looks, the car's cool.
 - Positive?
 Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.
 As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.
 Good enough.
 Let's go back to the kitchen.
 - Here you go, Mr.
 Wolf.
 - Thank you, Jimmie.
 Okay, first thing.
 You two.
 Take the body, stick it in the trunk.
 Now, Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house.
 That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit.
 Yeah.
 Under the sink.
 Good.
 What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products and clean the inside of the car-I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.
 Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull.
 Get it out of there.
 Wipe down the upholstery.
 It don't need to be spick-and-span.
 You don't need to eat off it.
 Just give it a good once-over.
 What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.
 The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.
 We need to raid your linen closet.
 I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.
 The thicker the better, the darker the better.
 No whites.
 Can't use 'em.
 We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards with quilts and blankets so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.
 Jimmie, lead the way.
 Boys, get to work.
 Please would be nice.
 - Come again?
 - I said, a please would be nice.
 Get it straight, Buster.
 I'm not here to say please.
 I'm here to tell you what to do.
 And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick.
 I'm here to help.
 If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.
 No, Mr.
 Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated.
 Mr.
 Wolf, listen.
 I don't mean disrespect, okay?
 I respect you.
 I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.
 If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor.
 I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.
 So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.
 Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right?
 I can feel your look.
 It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.
 Green.
 Nothin' except for the mess inside.
 About 20 minutes.
 Nobody who'll be missed.
 You're a good man, Joe.
 Thanks a bunch.
 - How we comin', Jimmie?
 - Pretty good.
 I got it all here, but Mr.
 Wolf, you gotta understand something.
 Winston, Jimmie, Winston.
 Okay.
 You gotta understand something, Winston.
 No, thank you.
 This is our best linen here and it was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.
 They're not with us anymore.
 I wanna help-.
 Let me ask you a question.
 If you don't mind.
 No, no, please.
 Go ahead.
 Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt ginny, were they millionaires?
 No.
 Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.
 And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt - Ginny.
 - Ginny were here they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.
 I like oak myself.
 That's what I have in my bedroom.
 How about you, Jimmie?
 You an oak man?
 Oak's nice.
 Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit.
 This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.
 Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?
 Get the fuck out my face with that shit!
 The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull on account of your dumb ass.
 I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.
 Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red.
 I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.
 That's all.
 I could blow.
 - Oh, you ready to blow?
 - Yeah.
 Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker.
 Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly TNT.
 I'm the Guns of the Navarone.
 In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?
 You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail!
 We're fuckin' switchin'!
 I'm washin' windows, you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!
 Fine job, gentlemen.
 You may get out of this yet.
 I can't believe this is the same car.
 Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet.
 Phase one is complete-clean the car- which moves us right along to phase two: clean you two.
 Strip.
 - All the way?
 - To your bare ass.
 Quickly, gentlemen.
 We got about 15 minutes before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.
 Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit.
 Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?
 - You know what you two look like?
 - What?
 Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.
 Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.
 Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.
 Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbage man to pick up.
 Don't worry, we're taking it with us.
 Jim, the soap.
 - Vincent.
 - Okay, gentlemen.
 You both been to county before, I'm sure.
 Here it comes.
 - Goddamn!
 The water's fuckin' cold!
 - Yo!
 Yo!
 Yo!
 Better you than me, gentlemen.
 Don't be afraid of the soap.
 Spread it around.
 - Get 'em there a little bit.
 Vincent's hair.
 - Hey, get out of my hair!
 Come on, do it, goddamn it!
 Do it!
 Towel.
 You're dry enough.
 Toss 'em their clothes.
 Perfect.
 Perfect.
 We couldn't have planned this better.
 You guys look like-.
 What do they look like, Jimmie?
 Dorks.
 They look like a couple of dorks.
 Ha-ha-ha.
 They're your clothes, motherfucker.
 Come on, gentlemen.
 We're laughing our way right into prison.
 Don't make me beg.
 Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight.
 We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.
 Now, Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.
 The place is North Hollywood so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.
 Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
 Jules, you ride with me.
 Vincent, you follow in my Acura.
 Now, if we come across the path of any John Q.
 Laws - nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something.
 - Right.
 - What did I say?
 - Don't do shit unless.
 - Unless what?
 - Unless you do it first.
 Spoken like a true prodigy.
 How about you, Lash LaRue?
 Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?
 The gun went off.
 I don't know why.
 I'm cool, I promise you.
 Fair enough.
 Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up.
 If I get my car back any different than I gave it Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.
 Outta my way, Rex.
 - We cool?
 - Like it never happened.
 - All right.
 - Boys, this is Raquel.
 Someday all this will be hers.
 Hi.
 So, what's with the outfits?
 You guys going to a volleyball game or something?
 I'm takin' milady out to breakfast.
 Maybe I could drop you two off.
 Where do you live?
 - Redondo.
 - Inglewood.
 It's your future.
 I see a cab ride.
 Move outta the sticks, fellas.
 Say good night, Raquel.
 - Good night, Raquel.
 - I'll see you guys around.
 Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.
 Mr.
 Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work.
 Yeah, really.
 And thank you very much, Mr.
 Wolf.
 Call me Winston.
 You see that, young lady?
 Respect.
 - Respect for one's elders shows character.
 - I have character.
 Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.
 Wanna share a cab?
 I'd go for some breakfast.
 Feel like havin' breakfast with me?
 Cool.
 I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something.
 Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.
 - I know that now.
 - But was he cool or what?
 - Thank you.
 - Totally fuckin' cool, in control.
 Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.
 Want some bacon?
 - No, man, I don't eat pork.
 - Are you Jewish?
 I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.
 - Why not?
 - Pigs are filthy animals.
 I don't eat filthy animals.
 Yeah, but bacon tastes good.
 Pork chops taste good.
 Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know 'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.
 Pigs sleep and root in shit.
 That's a filthy animal.
 I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.
 How about a dog?
 Dog eats its own feces.
 I don't eat dog either.
 Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?
 I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy but they're definitely dirty.
 But a dog's got personality.
 Personality goes a long way.
 So, by that rationale if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal, is that true?
 We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.
 I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.
 Oh, man, that's good.
 That's good, man.
 You're startin' to lighten up.
 You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit.
 - I just been sittin' here, thinkin'.
 - About what?
 About the miracle we witnessed.
 Miracle you witnessed.
 I witnessed a freak occurrence.
 What is a miracle, Vincent?
 - Act of God.
 - And what's an act of God?
 When God makes the impossible possible.
 But this morning - I don't think qualifies.
 - Hey, Vincent.
 See, that shit don't matter.
 You're judging this shit the wrong way.
 It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.
 You don't judge shit like this based on merit.
 Now, whether or not what we experienced was an According-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.
 But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God.
 God got involved.
 But why?
 Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why.
 - But I can't go back to sleep.
 - You're serious.
 You're really thinkin' about quittin'.
 - For life?
 Most definitely.
 - Yeah.
 Fuck.
 What you gonna do then?
 Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating.
 First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.
 Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the earth.
 - What you mean,
"'Walk the earth
"?
 - Like Caine in Kung Fu.
 Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures.
 And how long do you intend to walk the earth?
 - 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be.
 - What if he don't do that?
 If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.
 So you decided to be a bum.
 I'll just be Jules, Vincent.
 No more, no less.
 No, Jules, you decided to be a bum just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away.
 They got a name for that, Jules- It's called a bum.
 And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.
 You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.
 Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.
 Garcon!
 Coffee!
 Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.
 - But water into wine, I- - All shapes and sizes, Vincent.
 - Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man.
 - If my answers frighten you then you should cease asking scary questions.
 I'm gonna take a shit.
 Let me ask you something.
 When did you make this decision, when you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?
 Yeah.
 I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee replayin' the incident in my head when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.
 Fuck.
 To be continued.
 - I love you, pumpkin.
 - I love you, honey bunny.
 Everybody be cool!
 This is a robbery!
 Any one of you fucking pricks move and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!
 You got that?
 You just be quiet over there!
 Get on the fuckin'- get the fuck down!
 You're in a blind spot.
 Take your dames over to that booth, on the count often!
 - Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen!
 - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-.
 What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie?
 Get down!
 - Get down!
 - Throw those bags!
 Fucking move!
 Move!
 Move!
 Get the fuck- Get down on the fucking floor!
 Grandpa!
 Down!
 I'm the manager here, and there's no problem.
 No problem at all.
 - You gonna give me a problem?
 - No, sir, I'm not.
 Thought you said you were gonna give me a fucking problem!
 - I think we got a hero here, honey bunny.
 - Well, just execute him!
 I am not a hero.
 - I'm just a coffee shop manager.
 - Get the fuck down!
 The restaurant's ours!
 Just take whatever you want.
 - You talk to the customers.
 - Yeah.
 You tell them to be fucking cool and everything will be over.
 - You understand me?
 - Yes!
 Listen, everybody.
 Be calm, cooperate and this'll all be over in a minute!
 Get the fuck down!
 Well done.
 All right, now, people, gonna come around and collect your wallets!
 You don't fucking talk, you just throw 'em in the bag!
 Are we clear?
 I said, are we fucking clear?
 Good!
 Now, wallets out!
 That's it.
 Get the fuck down.
 In the bag.
 - In the fucking bag!
 - I don't have nothin' on me, man.
 In the bag.
 What am I waiting for?
 In the fucking bag.
 Laura.
 Laura.
 Tips.
 In the bag.
 - Is that a cellular phone?
 - Yeah.
 In the fucking bag.
 Tidy up, tidy up, that's it.
 Now get the fuck down on the floor.
 In the bag.
 In the bag.
 In the bag.
 - What's in the case?
 - My boss' dirty laundry.
 - Your boss makes you do his laundry?
 - When he wants it clean.
 - Sounds like a shit job.
 - Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.
 - Open it.
 - 'Fraid I can't do that.
 - I didn't hear you.
 - Yes, you did.
 What's going on?
 Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.
 Shoot him in the face!
 I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.
 If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last.
 Stop causing problems!
 You'll get us all killed!
 Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here!
 Shut the fuck up, fat man!
 This ain't none of your goddamn business!
 Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.
 No problem.
 I got it under control.
 Now, I'm gonna count to three.
 If you don't open that case, I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.
 We clear?
 One.
 Two.
 - Three.
 - Okay, Ringo.
 You win.
 It's yours.
 Open it.
 Hey, what is it?
 What is it?
 Is that what I think it is?
 It's beautiful.
 Goddamn it, what is it?
 You let him go!
 You let him go!
 - Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you!
 - Tell that bitch to be cool.
 - Say, '
"Bitch, be cool!

" Say,
"Bitch, be cool!

" - Be cool!
 Be cool!
 - Tell that bitch to chill!
 - You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!
 - Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
 - Chill out, honey bunny!
 - Let go of him!
 - Chill out, honey bunny!
 - Now, promise her it's gonna be all right!
 - I promise!
 - Tell her to chill!
 - Chill out, honey bunny!
 - Now tell me her name.
 - Yolanda.
 All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?
 - Don't you hurt him!
 - Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!
 We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here.
 And what's Fonzie like?
 - Come on, Yolanda!
 What's Fonzie like?
 - He's cool.
 - What?
 - Cool.
 Correctamundo.
 And that's what we're gonna be.
 We're gonna be cool.
 Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.
 And when I count three I want you to let go of your gun put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down.
 And when you do it you do it cool.
 You ready?
 One two three.
 - Okay, now you let him go!
 - Yolanda!
 I thought you were gonna be cool.
 Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.
 When I get nervous, I get scared.
 When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.
 Just know, you hurt him, you die.
 Well, that seems to be the situation.
 But I don't want that.
 And you don't want that.
 And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.
 So let's see what we can do.
 Now here's the situation.
 Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you.
 But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me.
 Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning to just hand it over to your dumb ass.
 Vincent!
 - Be cool!
 Yolanda, it's cool, baby.
 - Get back!
 It's cool!
 We still just talkin'.
 Come on.
 Point the gun at me.
 Point the gun at me.
 There you go.
 Now, Vincent, you just hang back and don't do a goddamn thing.
 Tell her it's still cool.
 - It's still cool, honey bunny.
 - How we doin', baby?
 I gotta go pee.
 I wanna go home.
 Hang in there, baby.
 I'm proud of you.
 And Ringo's proud of you.
 It's almost over.
 Tell her you're proud of her.
 - I'm proud of you, honey bunny.
 - I love you.
 I love you too, honey bunny.
 Now, I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.
 - Which one is it?
 - It's the one that says bad motherfucker.
 That's it.
 That's my bad motherfucker.
 Open it up.
 Take out the money.
 Count it.
 How much is there?
 About 1,500 dollars.
 Okay, put it in your pocket.
 It's yours.
 Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh?
 Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars and I'll shoot him on general principle.
 No, Yolanda!
 Yolanda!
 He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!
 Vince, shut the fuck up!
 - Shut up!
 - Come on, Yolanda.
 Stay with me, baby.
 Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.
 I'm buyin' something for my money.
 - Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo?
 - What?
 Your life.
 I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass.
 You read the Bible, Ringo?
 Not regularly, no.
 Well, there's this passage I got memorized.
 Ezekiel 25:17.

"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides
" by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.
 Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
 And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.
 And you will know I am the Lord
"when I lay my vengeance upon you.

" I been sayin' that shit for years and if you heard it, that meant your ass.
 I never gave much thought to what it meant.
 I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker before I popped a cap in his ass.
 But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.
 See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man and Mr.
 9-millimeter here, he's the shepherd protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness.
 Or it could mean you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd and it's the world that's evil and selfish.
 Yeah, I'd like that.
 But that shit ain't the truth.
 The truth is you're the weak and I'm the tyranny of evil men.
 But I'm tryin', Ringo.
 I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.
 Go.
 I think we should be leaving now.
 Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
 While I'm very familiar with you and your family, I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am.
 Are you aware of my existence?
 Yes.
 This is good.
 Now, are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France?
 Yes.
 Please tell me what you've heard.
 I've heard that the Führer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are either hiding or passing for Gentile.
 The Führer couldn't have said it better himself.
 But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me.
 The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews and found nothing.
 I'm aware of that.
 I've read the reports of this area.
 But like any enterprise, when under new management, there is always a slight duplication of efforts, most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless.
 I just have a few questions, monsieur LaPadite.
 If you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family.
 Now, before the occupation, there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself.
 Doleracs, Rollins, the Loveitts and the Dreyfuses.
 Is that correct?
 To my knowledge, those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers.
 Herr Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe?
 Please, monsieur LaPadite, this is your house, make yourself comfortable.
 Now, according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for except the Dreyfuses.
 Somewhere in the last year it would appear they've vanished.
 Which leads me to the conclusion that they've either made good their escape or someone is very successfully hiding them.
 What have you heard about the Dreyfuses, monsieur LaPadite?
 Only rumors.
 I love rumors!
 Facts could be so misleading, where rumors, true or false, are often revealing.
 So, monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding the Dreyfuses?
 Again, this is just a rumor, but we heard the Dreyfuses had made their way into Spain.
 So, the rumors you've heard have been of escape?
 Yes.
 Having never met the Dreyfuses, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names?
 There were five of them.
 The father, Jacob.
 Wife, Miram.
 And her brother, Bob.
 How old is Bob?
 Thirty, 31.
 Continue.
 And the children, Amos and Shosanna.
 Ages of the children?
 Amos was nine or 10.
 And Shosanna?
 And Shosanna was 18 or 19.
 I'm not really sure.
 Well, I guess that should do it.
 However, before I go, could I have another glass of your delicious milk?
 But of course.
 Monsieur LaPadite, are you aware of the nickname the people of France have given me?
 I have no interest in such things.
 But you are aware of what they call me.
 I'm aware.
 What are you aware of?
 That they call you
"The Jew Hunter.

" Precisely.
 I understand your trepidation in repeating it.
 Heydrich apparently hates the moniker the good people of Prague have bestowed on him.
 Actually, why he would hate the name
"the Hangman
" is baffling to me.
 lt would appear he has done everything in his power to earn it.
 Now I, on the other hand, love my unofficial title precisely because I've earned it.
 The feature that makes me such an effective hunter of the Jews is, as opposed to most German soldiers, I can think like a Jew where they can only think like a German.
 More precisely, a German soldier.
 Now, if one were to determine what attribute the German people share with a beast, it would be the cunning and the predatory instinct of a hawk.
 But if one were to determine what attributes the Jews share with a beast, it would be that of the rat.
 The Führer and Goebbels' propaganda have said pretty much the same thing.
 But where our conclusions differ, is I don't consider the comparison an insult.
 Consider for a moment the world a rat lives in.
 It's a hostile world, indeed.
 If a rat were to scamper through your front door, right now, would you greet it with hostility?
 I suppose I would.
 Has a rat ever done anything to you to create this animosity you feel toward them?
 Rats spread disease.
 They bite people.
 Rats were the cause of the bubonic plague, but that's some time ago.
 I propose to you any disease a rat could spread, a squirrel could equally carry.
 Would you agree?
 Yet, I assume you don't share the same animosity with squirrels that you do with rats, do you?
 No.
 Yet, they're both rodents, are they not?
 And except for the tail, they even rather look alike, don't they?
 It's an interesting thought, Herr Colonel.
 However interesting as the thought may be, it makes not one bit of difference to how you feel.
 If a rat were to walk in here, right now, as I'm talking would you greet it with a saucer of your delicious milk?
 Probably not.
 I didn't think so.
 You don't like them.
 You don't really know why you don't like them.
 All you know is you find them repulsive.
 Consequently, a German soldier conducts a search of a house suspected of hiding Jews.
 Where does the hawk look?
 He looks in the barn, he looks in the attic, he looks in the cellar, he looks everywhere he would hide.
 But there are so many places it would never occur to a hawk to hide.
 However, the reason the Führer has brought me off my Alps in Austria and placed me in French cow country today is because it does occur to me.
 Because I'm aware what tremendous feats human beings are capable of once they abandon dignity.
 May I smoke my pipe as well?
 Please, Herr Colonel, make yourself at home.
 Now, my job dictates that I must have my men enter your home and conduct a thorough search before I can officially cross your family's name off my list.
 And if there are any irregularities to be found, rest assured they will be.
 That is unless you have something to tell me that makes the conducting of a search unnecessary.
 I might add, also, that any information that makes the performance of my duty easier will not be met with punishment.
 Actually, quite the contrary.
 It will be met with reward.
 And that reward will be, your family will cease to be harassed in any way by the German military during the rest of our occupation of your country.
 You're sheltering enemies of the state, are you not?
 Yes.
 You're sheltering them underneath your floorboards, aren't you?
 Yes.
 Point out to me the areas where they're hiding.
 Since I haven't heard any disturbance, I assume, while they're listening, they don't speak English.
 Yes.
 I'm going to switch back to French now, and I want you to follow my masquerade.
 ls that clear?
 Yes.
 It's the girl.
 Au revoir, Shosanna!
 Ten-hut!
 My name is Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
 And I'm putting together a special team, and I need me eight soldiers.
 Eight Jewish American soldiers.
 Now, you all might've heard rumors about the armada happening soon.
 Well, we'll be leaving a little earlier.
 We're going to be dropped into France dressed as civilians.
 Once we're in enemy territory, as a bushwhacking guerrilla army, we're going to be doing one thing and one thing only.
 Killing Nazis.
 I don't know about you all, but I sure as hell didn't come down from the goddamn Smoky Mountains, cross 5,000 miles of water, fight my way through half of Sicily and jump out of a fucking airplane to teach the Nazis lessons in humanity.
 Nazi ain't got no humanity.
 They're the foot soldiers of a Jew-hating, mass-murdering maniac and they need to be destroyed.
 That's why any and every son of a bitch we find wearing a Nazi uniform, they're going to die.
 Now, I'm the direct descendent of the mountain man Jim Bridger.
 That means I got a little lndian in me.
 And our battle plan will be that of an Apache resistance.
 We will be cruel to the Germans.
 And through our cruelty, they will know who we are.
 And they will find the evidence of our cruelty in the disemboweled, dismembered and disfigured bodies of their brothers we leave behind us.
 And the German won't be able to help themselves but imagine the cruelty their brothers endured at our hands, and our boot heels and the edge of our knives.
 And the German will be sickened by us.
 And the German will talk about us.
 And the German will fear us.
 And when the German closes their eyes at night and they're tortured by their subconscious for the evil they have done, it will be with thoughts of us that they are tortured with.
 Sound good?
 Yes, sir!
 That's what I like to hear.
 But I got a word of warning for all you would-be warriors.
 When you join my command, you take on debit.
 A debit you owe me, personally.
 Each and every man under my command owes me 100 Nazi scalps.
 And I want my scalps.
 And all y'all will get me 100 Nazi scalps taken from the heads of 100 dead Nazis.
 Or you will die trying!
 Hey, Hirschberg.
 Send that Kraut sarge over.
 You.
 Go.
 Sergeant Werner Rachtman.
 Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
 Pleased to meet you.
 You know what
"sit down
" means, Werner?
 Yes.
 Then sit down.
 How is your English, Werner?
 Because if need be, we got a couple of fellows who can translate.
 Wicki here, an Austrian-Jew, got the fuck out of Munich while the getting was good.
 Became American, got drafted, come back to give y'all what for.
 Another one up there you might be familiar with.
 Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz.
 Heard of him?
 Everybody in the German Army has heard of Hugo Stiglitz.
 The reason for Hugo Stiglitz's celebrity among German soldiers is simple.
 As a German-enlisted man, he killed 13 Gestapo officers.
 Instead of putting him up against a wall, the High Command decided to send him back to Berlin to be made an example of.
 Needless to say, once the Basterds heard about him, he never got there.
 Sergeant Hugo Stiglitz?
 Lieutenant Aldo Raine.
 These are the Basterds.
 Ever heard of us?
 We just want to say we're a big fan of your work.
 When it comes to killing Nazis  I think you show great talent.
 And I pride myself for having an eye for that kind of talent.
 But your status as a Nazi killer is still amateur.
 We all come here to see if you want to go pro.
 Can I assume you know who we are?
 You're Aldo the Apache.
 Werner, if you heard of us, you probably heard we ain't in the prisoner-taking business.
 We in the killing Nazi business, and, cousin, business is a-booming.
 Oh, yeah.
 Now, that leaves two ways we can play this out.
 Either kill you or let you go.
 Whether or not you're going to leave this ditch alive depends entirely on you.
 Up the road a piece, there's an orchard.
 Besides you, we know there's another Kraut patrol fucking around here somewhere.
 If that patrol were to have any crack shots, that orchard would be a goddamn sniper's delight.
 So if you ever want to eat a sauerkraut sandwich again, you got to show me on this here map where they are.
 You got to tell me how many they are, and you got to tell me what kind of artillery they're carrying with them.
 You can't expect me to divulge information that would put German lives in danger.
 Well, now, Werner, that's where you're wrong, because that's exactly what I expect.
 I need to know about Germans hiding in trees.
 And you need to tell me.
 And you need to tell me right now.
 Now, just take that finger of yours and point out on this here map where this party is being held, how many is coming and what they brought to play with.
 I respectfully refuse, sir.
 Hear that?
 Yes.
 That's Sergeant Donny Donowitz.
 You might know him better by his nickname.
 The Bear Jew.
 Now, if you heard of Aldo the Apache, you got to have heard about The Bear Jew.
 I heard of The Bear Jew.
 What did you hear?
 Beats German soldiers with a club.
 He bashes their brains in with a baseball bat, what he does.
 And, Werner, I'm going to ask you one last goddamn time, and if you still respectfully refuse, I'm calling The Bear Jew over.
 He's going to take that big bat of his, and he's going to beat your ass to death with it.
 Now, take your Wiener-schnitzel-licking finger, and point out on this map what I want to know.
 Fuck you.
 And your Jew dogs.
 Actually, Werner, we're all tickled to hear you say that.
 Quite frankly, watching Donny beat Nazis to death is the closest we ever get to going to the movies.
 Donny!
 Yeah?
 Got us a German here who wants to die for country.
 Oblige him.
 Did you get that for killing Jews?
 Bravery.
 Yeah!
 - Oh, no!
 - Oh, no!
 Donny!
 Yeah, Donny!
 About now I'd be shitting my pants if I was you.
 Teddy Fucking Williams knocks it out of the park!
 Fenway Park is on its feet for Teddy Fucking Ballgame!
 He went yard on that one, on to fucking Lansdowne Street!
 You!
 Damn it, Hirschberg!
 Donny, bring that other one over here.
 Alive!
 Get the fuck up!
 Batter up.
 You're on deck!
 Two hits.
 I hit you, you hit the ground.
 English?
 Wicki.
 Ask him if he wants to live.
 Tell him to point out on this map the German position.
 Ask him how many Germans.
 Around about 12.
 What kind of artillery?
 Now, when you report what happened here, you can't tell them you told us what you told us.
 They'll shoot you.
 They're going to want to know why you so special, we let you live.
 So tell them, we let you live so you could spread the word through the ranks what's going to happen to every Nazi we find.
 Now that you've survived the war, when you get home, what you going to do?
 WlCKl: He's going to hug his mother.
 Well, ain't that nice?
 Ask if he's going to take off his uniform.
 He's going to burn it.
 Yeah, that's what we thought.
 We don't like that.
 See, we like our Nazis in uniforms.
 That way you can spot them.
 Just like that.
 But you take off that uniform, ain't nobody going to know you's a Nazi.
 And that don't sit well with us.
 So I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
 You know, Lieutenant, you're getting pretty good at that.
 You know how you get to Carnegie Hall, don't you?
 Practice.
 Au revoir, Shosanna!
 At that time, 35 millimeter nitrate film was so flammable that you couldn't even bring a reel onto a streetcar.
 Hey, you can't bring those here on a public vehicle.
 They're films, ain't they?
 Yes.
 Then they're flammable.
 Go on, hop off.
 Because nitrate film burns three times faster than paper.
 Shosanna has a collection of over 350 nitrate film prints.
 Right this way, Lieutenant.
 Lieutenant Archie Hicox reporting, sir.
 General Ed Fenech.
 At ease, Hicox.
 Drink?
 If you offer me a scotch and plain water, I could drink a scotch and plain water.
 That-a-boy, Lieutenant.
 Make it yourself like a good chap, will you?
 The bar is in the globe.
 Something for yourself, sir?
 Whiskey.
 Straight.
 No junk in it.
 lt says here that you speak German fluently.
 Like a Katzenjammer Kid.
 And your occupation before the war?
 I'm a film critic.
 List your accomplishments.
 Well, sir, such as they are, I write reviews and articles for a publication called Films and Filmmakers, and I've had two books published.
 Impressive.
 Don't be modest, Lieutenant.
 What are their titles?
 The first book was called Art of the Eyes, the Heart and the Mind: A Study of German Cinema in the '20s.
 And the second one was called Twenty-Four Frame da Vinci.
 It's a sub textual film criticism study of the work of German director G.
W.
 Pabst.
 What should we drink to, sir?
 Well Down with Hitler.
 All the way down, sir.
 Yes.
 Are you familiar with German cinema under the Third Reich?
 Yes.
 Obviously, I haven't seen any of the films made in the last three years, but I'm familiar with it.
 Explain it to me.
 Pardon, sir?
 Well, this little escapade of ours requires a knowledge of the German film industry under the Third Reich.
 Explain to me UFA under Goebbels.
 Goebbels considers the films he's making to be the beginning of a new era in German cinema.
 An alternative to what he considers the Jewish-German intellectual cinema of the '20s, and the Jewish-controlled dogma of Hollywood.
 How's he doing?
 Frightfully sorry, sir.
 Once again?
 You say he wants to take on the Jews at their own game.
 Well, compared to, say, Louis B.
 Mayer, how's he doing?
 Quite well, actually.
 Since Goebbels has taken over, film attendance has steadily risen in Germany over the last eight years.
 But Louis B.
 Mayer wouldn't be Goebbels' proper opposite number.
 I believe Goebbels sees himself closer to David O.
 Selznick.
 Brief him.
 Lieutenant Hicox, at this point and time I'd like to brief you on Operation Kino.
 Three days from now Joseph Goebbels is throwing a gala premiere of one of his new movies in Paris.
 What film, sir?
 The motion picture is called Nation's Pride.
 In attendance at this joyous Germatic occasion will be Goebbels, Goring, Bormann, and most of the German High Command including all high ranking officers of both the SS and the Gestapo, as well as luminaries of the Nazi propaganda film industry.
 The master race at play?
 Basically, we have all our rotten eggs in one basket.
 The objective of Operation Kino, blow up the basket.
 And like the snows of yesteryear, gone from this earth.
 Jolly good, sir.
 An American Secret Service outfit that lives deep behind enemy lines will be your assist.
 The Germans call them the Basterds.
 The Basterds.
 Never heard of them.
 Whole point of the Secret Service, old boy, you not hearing of them.
 But the Jerries have heard of them, because these Yanks have been them the devil.
 You'll be dropped into France, about 24 kilometers outside of Paris.
 The Basterds will be waiting for you.
 First thing, you'll go to a little village called Nadine.
 In Nadine, there's a tavern called La Louisiane.
 There you'll rendezvous with our double agent.
 She'll take it from there.
 She's the one who is going to get you into the premiere.
 It'll be you, her, and two German-born members of the Basterds.
 She's also made all the other arrangements you're going to need.
 How will I know her?
 I suspect that won't be too much trouble for you.
 Your contact is Bridget von Hammersmark.
 Bridget von Hammersmark?
 The German movie star is working for England?
 Yes, for the last two years now.
 One could even say that Operation Kino was her brainchild.
 Indeed.
 Got the gist?
 I think so, sir.
 Paris when it sizzles.
 You didn't say the goddamn rendezvous is in a fucking basement.
 l didn't know.
 You said it was in a tavern.
 lt is a tavern.
 Yeah, in a basement.
 You know, fighting in a basement offers a lot of difficulties.
 Number one being, you're fighting in a basement.
 What if we go in there and she's not even there?
 We wait.
 Don't worry.
 She's a British spy.
 She'll make the rendezvous.
 Stiglitz, right?
 That's right, sir.
 l hear you're pretty good with that.
 You know, we're not looking for trouble right now.
 Simply making contact with our agent.
 Should be uneventful.
 However, the off chance I'm wrong, things prove eventful, I need to know we can all remain calm.
 I don't look calm to you?
 Well, now that you put it like that, l guess you do.
 This Jerry of yours, Stiglitz, not exactly the loquacious type, is he?
 ls that the kind of man you need?
 Loquacious type?
 Fair point, Lieutenant.
 So you all get in trouble in there, what are we supposed to do?
 Make bets on how it all comes out?
 If we get into trouble, we can handle it.
 But if trouble does happen, we need you to make damn sure no Germans, or French, for that matter, escape from that basement.
 If Frau von Hammersmark's cover is compromised, the mission is kaput.
 Speaking of Frau von Hammersmark, whose idea was it for the deathtrap rendezvous?
 She chose the spot.
 Isn't that just dandy?
 Look, she's not a military strategist.
 She's just an actress.
 You don't got to be Stonewall Jackson to know you don't want to fight in a basement.
 She wasn't picking a place to fight.
 She was picking a place isolated and without Germans.
 Mmm.
 Well, if this is it, old boy, l hope you don't mind if I go out speaking the King's.
 By all means, Captain.
 There's a special rung in hell reserved for people who waste good Scotch.
 Seeing as I may be rapping on the door momentarily, l must say, damn good stuff, sir.
 Now, about this pickle we find ourselves in.
 lt would appear there's only one thing left for you to do.
 And what would that be?
 Stiglitz.
 Say auf Wiedersehen to your Nazi balls.
 You outside.
 Who are you?
 British?
 American?
 What?
 We're American.
 What are you?
 I'm a German, you idiot.
 Speak English pretty good for a German.
 l agree.
 So let's talk.
 Okay, talk.
 I'm a father.
 My baby was born today.
 ln Frankfurt.
 Five hours ago.
 H is name is Max.
 We were in here drinking, celebrating.
 They're the ones that came in shooting and killing.
 It's not my fault!
 Okay!
 lt wasn't your fault.
 What's your name, soldier?
 Wilhelm.
 Now, is there anybody alive on our side?
 No.
 I'm alive!
 Who's that?
 ls the girl on your side?
 Which girl?
 Who do you think?
 Von Hammersmark.
 Yeah, she's ours.
 ls she okay?
 Wilhelm!
 She's been shot.
 But she's alive.
 Okay, Wilhelm.
 What do you say we make us a deal?
 What's your name?
 Aldo.
 Okay, Wilhelm, here's my deal.
 You let me and one of my men come down there and take the girl away.
 No guns.
 No guns me, no guns you.
 And we take the girl and leave.
 It's that simple, Willi.
 You go your way, we go ours.
 And little Max gets to grow up playing catch with his daddy.
 So what do you say, Willi?
 We got us a deal?
 Aldo.
 I'm here, Willi.
 l want to trust you.
 But But how can l?
 What choice you got, son?
 Okay, okay.
 Aldo, I'm going to trust you.
 Come down.
 Hey, Willi, what's with the machine gun?
 l thought we had us a deal?
 We still have a deal.
 Now, get the girl and go.
 Not so fast.
 We only got a deal, we trust each other.
 And a Mexican standoff ain't trust.
 You need guns on me for it to be a Mexican standoff.
 You got guns on us.
 You decide to shoot, we're dead.
 Up top, they got grenades.
 They drop them down here, you're dead.
 That's a Mexican standoff, and that was not the deal.
 No trust, no deal.
 All right, Aldo.
 Fine.
 Just take that fucking traitor, and get her out of my sight.
 Not so goddamn fast, doc.
 Tell him to go play with his dogs.
 Before we yank that slug out you, you need to answer a few questions.
 Few questions about what?
 About I got three men dead back there.
 Why don't you try telling us what the fuck happened?
 The British officer blew his German act and the Gestapo major saw it.
 Before we get into who shot John, why'd you invite my men to a rendezvous in a basement with a bunch of Nazis?
 l can see since you didn't see what happened inside, that the Nazis being there must look odd.
 Yeah, we got a word for that kind of odd in English.
 It's called suspicious.
 Everybody needs to calm down.
 You're letting your imagination get the better of you.
 You met the sergeant yourself.
 Willi.
 You remember him, don't you?
 Yeah, I remember him.
 His wife had a baby tonight.
 He had just become a He had just become a father!
 His commanding officer gave him and his mates the night off to celebrate.
 The Germans being there was either a trap set by me or a tragic coincidence.
 It couldn't be both.
 How'd the shooting start?
 The Englishman gave himself away.
 How'd he do that?
 He ordered three glasses.
 We order three glasses.
 That's the German three.
 The other looks odd.
 Germans would and did notice it.
 Okay, let's pretend there were no Germans and everything went exactly the way it was supposed to.
 What was the next step?
 Tuxedos.
 To get them into the premiere wearing military uniforms with all the military there would've been suicide.
 But going as members of the German film industry, they wear tuxedos and fit in with everybody else.
 I arranged for the tailor to fit three tuxedos tonight.
 How'd you intend to get them in that premiere?
 Hand me my purse.
 Lieutenant Hicox was going as my escort.
 The other two were going as a German cameraman and his assistant.
 You still get us in that premiere?
 You speak German better than your friends?
 No.
 Have I been shot?
 Yes!
 I don't see me tripping the light fantastique up a red carpet anytime soon.
 Least of all, by tomorrow night.
 However, there's something you don't know.
 There've been two recent developments regarding Operation Kino.
 One, the venue has been changed from The Ritz to a much smaller venue.
 Enormous change at the last minute?
 That's not very Germatic.
 Why the hell is Goebbels doing stuff so damn peculiar?
 It probably has something to do with the second development.
 Which is?
 Der Fuhrer is attending the premiere.
 Fuck a duck!
 What are you thinking?
 I'm thinking getting a whack at planting old Uncle Adolf makes this horse a different color.
 What is that supposed to mean?
 lt means you getting us in that premiere.
 I'm probably going to end up losing this leg.
 Bye-bye, acting career.
 Fun while it lasted.
 How do you expect me to walk the red carpet?
 Doggy doc's going to dig that slug out your gam.
 He's going to wrap it up in a cast, and you got a good how-l-broke-my-leg- mountain-climbing story.
 That's German, ain't it?
 You all like climbing mountains, don't you?
 I don't.
 I like smoking, drinking and ordering in restaurants.
 But I see your point.
 We fill you up with morphine till it's coming out your ears and just limp your little ass up that reuge carpet.
 I know this is a silly question before I ask it, but can you Americans speak any other language than English?
 We both speak a little ltalian.
 With an atrocious accent, no doubt.
 But that doesn't exactly kill us in the crib.
 Germans don't have a good ear for ltalian.
 So you mumble ltalian and brazen through it.
 Is that the plan?
 That's about it.
 That sounds good.
 It sounds like shit.
 What else are we going to do?
 Go home?
 No, that sounds good.
 If you don't blow it, with that, I can get you in the building.
 Who does what?
 Well, I speak the most ltalian, so I'll be your escort.
 Donowitz speaks second most, so he'll be your Italian cameraman.
 Omar, third most.
 He'll be Donny's assistant.
 I don't speak ltalian.
 Like I said, third best.
 Just keep your fucking mouth shut.
 In fact, why don't you start practicing right now?
 Yes.
 Gorlomi?
 Gorlomi.
 Gorlomi.
 Antonio Margheriti.
 Margheriti.
 Margheriti.
 Dominick Decocco.
 Dominick Decocco.
 What's that American expression?

"If the shoe fits, you must wear it.

" Fucking shithead.
 Faggot fuck.
 Fuck you!
 Bunch of shithead fuck.
 Fuck you, too!
 Goddamn Nazi farts, sons of bitches!
 Get your hands off me.
 You fucking bratwurst-smelling Goddamn you!
 Get off!
 Hmm.
 You Jerry-banging, Limburg-smelling As Stanley said to Livingstone, Lieutenant Aldo Raine, I presume?
 Hans Landa.
 You've had a nice long run, Aldo.
 Alas, you're now in the hands of the SS.
 My hands to be exact.
 And they've been waiting a long time to touch you.
 Caught you flinching.
 Touch me again, Kraut-burger.
 Utivich?
 Is that you, Lieutenant?
 Yeah.
 Do you know what happened to Donny?
 Omar?
 The woman?
 No, I do not.
 Tell me, Aldo, if I were sitting where you're sitting, would you show me mercy?
 Nope.
 What is that English expression about shoes and feet?

"Looks like the shoe is on the other foot.

" Yeah, I was just thinking that.
 So you're Aldo the Apache.
 So you're The Jew Hunter.
 I'm a detective.
 A damn good detective.
 Finding people is my specialty, so naturally, I worked for the Nazis finding people.
 And, yes, some of them were Jews.
 But Jew Hunter?
 Just a name that stuck.
 Well, you do have to admit, it is catchy.
 Do you control the nicknames your enemies bestow on you?
 Aldo the Apache and the Little Man?
 What do you mean the Little Man?
 Germans' nickname for you.
 The Germans' nickname for me is the Little Man?
 And as if to make my point, I'm a little surprised how tall you were in real life.
 l mean, you're a little fellow, but not circus-midget little, as your reputation would suggest.
 Where's my men?
 Where's Bridget von Hammersmark?
 Well, let's just say, she got what she deserved.
 And when you purchase friends like Bridget von Hammersmark, you get what you pay for.
 Now as far as your paesanos, Sergeant Donowitz and Private Omar How you know our names?
 Lieutenant Aldo, if you don't think I wouldn't interrogate every single one of your swastika-marked survivors, we simply aren't operating on the level of mutual respect I assumed.
 No, I guess not.
 Well, back to the whereabouts of your two ltalian saboteurs.
 As of this moment, both Omar and Donowitz should be sitting in the very seats we left them in.
 Double-zero 23 and double-zero 24, if my memory serves.
 Explosives still around their ankles, still ready to explode.
 And your mission, some would call a terrorist plot, as of this moment, is still a go.
 That's a pretty exciting story.
 What's next?
 Eliza on lce?
 However, all I have to do is pick up this phone right here, inform the cinema, and your plan is kaput.
 If they're still here, and if they're still alive, and that's one big if, there ain't no way you're going to take them boys without setting off them bombs.
 I have no doubt.
 And, yes, some Germans will die.
 Yes, it will ruin the evening.
 And, yes, Goebbels will be very, very, very mad at you for what you've done to his big night.
 But you won't get Hitler, you won't get Goebbels, you won't get Goring, and you won't get Bormann.
 And you need all four to end the war.
 But if I don't pick up this phone right here, you may very well get all four.
 And if you get all four, you end the war tonight.
 So, gentlemen, let's discuss the prospect of ending the war tonight.
 So, the way I see it, since Hitler's death or possible rescue rests solely on my reaction, if I do nothing, it's as if I'm causing his death even more than yourselves.
 Wouldn't you agree?
 I guess so.
 How about you, Utivich?
 I guess so, too.
 Gentlemen, l have no intention of killing Hitler and killing Goebbels and killing Goring and killing Bormann, not to mention winning the war single-handedly for the Allies, only later to find myself standing before a Jewish tribunal.
 If you want to win the war tonight, we have to make a deal.
 What kind of deal?
 The kind you wouldn't have the authority to make.
 However, I'm sure this mission of yours has a commanding officer.
 A general.
 I'm betting for OSS would be my guess.
 That's a bingo!
 Is that the way you say it?

"That's a bingo.

" You just say,
"Bingo.

" Bingo!
 How fun.
 But I digress.
 Where were we?
 Yeah!
 Make a deal.
 Over there is a very capable two-way radio and sitting behind it is a more than capable radio operator named Hermann.
 Get me someone on the other end of that radio with the power of the pen to authorize my, let's call it, the terms of my conditional surrender.
 If that tastes better going down.
 You know, where I'm from Yeah?
 Where is that exactly?
 Maynardville, Tennessee.
 I've done my share of bootlegging.
 Up there, if you engage in what the federal government calls illegal activity, but what we call just a man trying to make a living for his family selling moonshine liquor, it behooves oneself to keep his wits.
 Long story short, we hear a story too good to be true, it ain't.
 Sitting in your chair, l would probably say the same thing, and 999.
999 times out of a million, you would be correct.
 But in the pages of history, every once in a while, fate reaches out and extends its hand.
 What shall the history books read?
 I implore you.
 We must destroy that tower.
 Sarge, that tower The tower stands!
 Psst!
 Psst!
 So when the military history of this night is written, it will be recorded that I was part of Operation Kino from the very beginning as a double agent.
 Anything I've done in my guise as an SS Colonel was sanctioned by the OSS as a necessary evil to establish my cover with the Germans.
 And it was my placement of Lieutenant Raine's dynamite in Hitler and Goebbels' opera box that assured their demise.
 By the way, that last part is actually true.
 I want my full military pension and benefits under my proper rank.
 I want to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor for my invaluable assistance in the toppling of the Third Reich.
 In fact, I want all the members of Operation Kino to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor.
 Full citizenship for myself.
 Well, that goes without saying.
 And I would like the United States of America to purchase property for me on Nantucket lsland as a reward for all the countless lives I've saved by bringing the tyranny of the National Socialist Party to a swifter-than-imagined end.
 Do you have all that, sir?
 l look forward to seeing you face to face as well, sir.
 Lieutenant Raine?
 Right here.
 Yes, sir.
 Colonel Landa will put you and Private Utivich in a truck as prisoners.
 Then he and his radio operator will get in the truck and drive to our lines.
 Upon crossing our lines, Colonel Landa and his man will surrender to you.
 You will then take over driving of the truck and bring them straight to me for debriefing.
 ls that clear, Lieutenant?
 Yes, sir.
 Over and out.
 When I kill that guy, you got 30 feet to get to that guard.
 Can you do it?
 I have to.
 Champagne?
 Who wants to send a message to Germany?
 I have a message for Germany.
 That you are all going to die.
 And I want you to look deep into the face of the Jew who's going to do it!
 Marcel, burn it down.
 Oui, Shosanna.
 My name is Shosanna Dreyfus, and this is the face of Jewish vengeance.
 Hermann, uncuff them.
 I'm officially surrendering myself over to you, Lieutenant Raine.
 We're your prisoners.
 How about my knife?
 Thank you very much, Colonel.
 Utivich, cuff the Colonel's hands behind his back.
 ls that really necessary?
 I'm a slave to appearances.
 Scalp Hermann.
 Are you mad?
 What have you done?
 I made a deal with your general for that man's life!
 Yeah, they made that deal.
 But they don't give a fuck about him.
 They need you.
 You'll be shot for this!
 Nah, I don't think so.
 More like chewed out.
 I've been chewed out before.
 You know, Utivich and myself heard that deal you made with the brass.
 End the war tonight?
 I'd make that deal.
 How about you, Utivich?
 You make that deal?
 I'd make that deal.
 I don't blame you.
 Damn good deal.
 And that pretty little nest you feathered for yourself.
 Well, if you're willing to barbecue the whole High Command, l suppose that's worth certain considerations.
 But I do have one question.
 When you get to your little place on Nantucket lsland, l imagine you are going to take off that handsome-looking SS uniform of yours.
 Ain't you?
 That's what I thought.
 Now, that I can't abide.
 How about you, Utivich, can you abide it?
 Not one damn bit, sir.
 l mean, if I had my way, you'd wear that goddamn uniform for the rest of your pecker-sucking life.
 But I'm aware that ain't practical.
 I mean, at some point, you're going to have to take it off.
 So, I'm going to give you a little something you can't take off.
 You know something, Utivich?
 I think this just might be my masterpiece.
 Hold on, I gotta come up!
 I've gotta take the world's biggest fucking piss.
 We can't be late!
 We won't!
 Who's who's holding?
 If you 're not, then nobody.
 We were kind of hoping you were.
 - Yeah.
 How are you not holding?
 - Jesus Christ, Shanna.
 It is not my fucking job to supply y'all with weed when we go out.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, little lady.
 You're gettin' angry kind of quick, don't you think?
 I was just teasin' you!
 I'm not angry.
 It just would be nice if y'all didn't just count on me all the fucking time and surprise me every once in a while with pot.
 Okay, mean girl in a high school movie.
 Are you through having a tantrum?
 I'm not having a tantrum.
 Yes, you are.
 You've been in the car all of two seconds, and you're already cursing at me.
 I am not cursing at you.
 You said
"Jesus Christ, Shanna,
" and then before the sentence was over you threw a
"fucking
" in there to emphasize your irritatedness.
 Come on, don't fight.
 I'll pay for it when we get some.
 One, it is not about the money.
 It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.
 And two, we're not really fighting.
 Arlene, you've forgotten what hanging out with Jungle Julia is like.
 That wasn't a fight.
 That was Julia acting like a grumpy bitch and me calling her on it and indulging her at the same time.
 That's how we tolerate each other after all these years.
 Oh!
 Billboard!
 So, what's the plan, man?
 Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.
 Did you call Rafael and tell him we're coming?
 - Of course.
 - You 're so good.
 I know.
 Okay, is Christian Simonson gonna be there?
 You bet your ass he is with Jesse Letterman.
 Christian Simonson, the filmmaker, is in town.
 He's got a big thing for Julia.
 If he had a big thing for me, he'd fucking call me, as opposed to disappearing for six months, and he'd get his ass down here more often than he does.
 And on my birthday he'd give me a fucking phone call.
 Oh, billboard!
 Yeah, but you get those legs of yours around him, and it's all over.
 Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating his house in the hills that I am also living in, I'll let you know it worked.
 So, margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's, touch base with Chris and Jesse, tell them about later, and make damn sure they come.
 Those other guys'll be waiting for us at the Texas Chili Parlor.
 Oh, shit.
 Speaking of which what happened with you and Nate last night?
 Well, you know, not much.
 We just fucking met each other.
 If you don't bust their balls a little bit, they're never gonna respect you.
 Okay, we're pretty clear on what it is you didn't do.
 How about enlightening us on what it is you did do?
 Oh, nothing to write home about.
 We just made out on the couch for about 20 minutes.
 Dressed, half-dressed, or naked?
 Dressed.
 I said we made out.
 We didn't do
"the thing.

" Oh, excuse me for living, but what is
"the thing
"?
 You know, it's everything but.
 They call that
"the thing
"?
 I call it
"the thing.

" Do guys like
"the thing
"?
 They like it better than
"no thing.

" Okay, I wanna get back to what it is you did do.
 So you're making out on the couch with Nate, right?
 Correct.
 Whose couch?
 His or the one in your hotel room?
 What am I, stupid over here?
 Mine.
 Were you making out sitting up or lying down?
 We started sitting up, we worked our way to lying down.
 Hmm.
 The plot thickens.
 Who was on top?
 I was straddling him.
 What else?
 That was it.
 So we made out for a little while on the couch and I said,
"Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now, so it's time for you to leave.

" And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?

" And I said,
"Yup, right now.
 Let's go.

" And he says,
"Wait, what about this?

" And I said no.
 He said,
"What do you mean?
 You don't know what I'm gonna say.

" I said,
"I already know what you're gonna say, and the answer's no.

" He said,
"Well, how can you say you know what I'm gonna say?

" And I said,
"Because you're gonna say, 'Let's just go to sleep together.
 'We don't gotta do nothing.
 'Just cuddle, sleep next to each other, wake up in the morning together.
'
"
"No.
 You 're gonna leave but I'll see you tomorrow.

" Yeah, fuck Nate.
 I mean, he's cute and all, but Jesse Letterman is gonna be all over her.
 Remember no hookin' up tonight.
 You can hang out with them, you can make out with them, but no hookin' up with them, because we are driving to Lake L.
B.
J.
 tonight, and my daddy's pretty clear about one thing He said,
"I am lettin' you and your girlfriends stay at my lake house, not you and a bunch of horny boys trying to get their fuck on with my daughter.

" - Your dad talks like that?
 - Hell yeah.
 And it's not like he ain't gonna know, either, because when I'm staying at the lake house with my girlfriends in our bikinis, Daddy just has a tendency to pop up and make sure we don't need anything.
 Look, he's totally harmless and cute as a bug's ear!
 But you know, when he's got a bunch of half-naked poontang walking the floor of his lake house, he just likes to pay us a visit and make sure we got everything we need.
 And if you flirt shamelessly with him, like the six-foot baby giraffe in the backseat, you got a puppy dog for life.
 I have my own relationship with Ben, and you're just jealous 'cause it don't include you.
 You call her dad
"Ben
"?
 I'm not a child.
 That's his name.
 So, when are the boys showing up?
 They're gonna meet us at the Chili Parlor.
 Maybe they can bring some pot.
 Fuck that.
 No.
 I don't wanna be either A, depending on their fucking ass, or B, depending on their ass.
 Uh-uh.
 If we don't score ourselves, we're gonna be stuck with them all fucking night.
 Ooh!
 Try Lanna-Frank.
 Best idea you had all day.
 Oh, hey!
 That's your last billboard before Guero's!
 Oh, come on, give me a break.
 Oh, come on, my ass!
 We said every time.
 Okay.
 Jules, let me get a drag.
 Thanks.
 Oh, my God.
 Hey, this is and I's U.
T.
 days, Arlene.
 Hey.
 - You wanna join us?
 - For a second, but I'm with some friends.
 Ooh So, you must be must be So, you must be the infamous Butterfly.
 Shh!
 She don't know nothing about it.
 - Know about what?
 - When were y'all gonna tell her?
 - Soon.
 - Tell me what?
 Yeah, now thanks to you, we've gotta tell her sooner than later.
 All right, cut the shit.
 What the fuck is going on?
 I said a little something-something about you on the air today.
 Julia, what the fuck did you say about me on the radio?
 All I said was I had a sexy friend named Butterfly who was in from out-of-town for the weekend, and we would be going out somewhere in Austin tonight, and if they were out on the town, maybe they'd see us.
 And I described you, and I said that if they spotted you while we were out, if they'd do something, you'd do something.
 Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.
 What did you say and what did you say I'd do?
 Anywho, I could explain what I said, which would be boring, or Marcy over here, who is an incredible actress, could act it out for you, which I think will give you a better idea what you have in store for you tonight.
 Okay, so just tell me your way.
 - So we'll act it out with Marcy?
 - Sure.
 Okay, give Marcy your drink.
 Okay, so you 're in a club or a bar, and Marcy's a kind of cute or kind of hot or kind of sexy or better be fucking hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy who you could fuck.
 Got it.
 Okay, Marcy, take it.
 Howdy.
 Hi, there.
 Excuse me, but your name wouldn't be
"Butterfly,
" would it?
 Yes, it is, and it seems you have me at a disadvantage.
 Barry.
 Pleased to meet you, Barry.
 Y'all are gettin' me hot!
 Shh!
 So is, uh
"Butterfly
" your real name?
 Yes, it is.
 And how'd you know my name, Barry?
 I listened to Jungle Julia's show this mornin'.
 Oh, you did, did you?
 Oh, yeah, I listen to her show every morning.
 Oh, you do, do you?
 Yeah, she's like the coolest lady in town.
 Don't you think she's got a big ass?
 Nah, man!
 I like her ass that way.
 She got a black girl's ass.
 Well, that's what she always says, but in actual fact, she doesn't really have a black girl's ass.
 She's got a big ass.
 Okay, what the fuck are you doing?
 Look who wants to get to the point all of a sudden.
 Okay, we'll get to the point, but for your information, skinny bitch, black men and a whole lot of motherfuckin' white men have had plenty of fun adoring my ass.
 I don't wear their teeth marks on my butt for nothing.
 If you're not gonna buy me a drink, can I have mine back?
 No, okay, okay, okay, okay.
 So, Butterfly can I buy you a drink?
 I'd love one.
 What can I get ya?
 I'll take a margarita.
 Here ya go.
 So, after they buy you a drink when they raise their glass to toast, they look you dead in the eye and repeat this poem
"The woods are lovely, dark and deep And I have promises to keep and miles to go before I sleep.

" Did you hear me, Butterfly?

"Miles to go before you sleep.

" And then, if they say that you gotta give 'em a lap dance.
 What?
 If they call you
"Butterfly,
" buy you a drink, repeat that poem, you gotta give 'em a lap dance.
 That's bullshit.
 I ain't giving them nothin'.
 Well, you can do it or not, but if you don't, everybody in Austin is gonna think you a chicken shit.
 And I don't think you want everybody in Austin thinking you're a chicken shit.
 I ain't giving nobody no lap dance 'cause of what you said.
 Oh, come on!
 It's gonna be funny!
 Yeah, everything's funny to you two when it's happening to me.
 Look.
 You don't have to do it for anybody you don't want.
 I said you'd do it for the first guy who says it.
 So, some geek comes over trying to be cool, just tell him you already did it at another place earlier.
 No harm, no foul, but you get a free drink out of it.
 But maybe a little later in the evening, you've had a few drinks, you're kind of loosey-goosey, you're safe with your girls, then some kind of cute, kind of hot, kind of sexy, hysterically funny, but not-funny-looking guy comes up and says it then maybe you did it earlier, maybe you didn't.
 She's making me trip.
 Shut the fuck up.
 You made me trip, dumb bitch!
 You fuckin' idiot!
 Baby It doesn't matter what they say I know I'm gonna love you any old way What can I do without you?
 Don't want nobody, nobody Baby, it's you Baby, it's you Don't leave me alone Come on home Baby, it's you Baby, it's you Any dead soldiers here?
 Uh, these two.
 Thank you.
 Where the hell is Lanna-Frank?
 That's a good fucking question.
 Lanna-Frank!
 Where are you?
 Well, come over already.
 We're waiting for you.
 - Shit!
 Hold on!
 So, where are you?
 Come over already.
 We're waiting for you.
 No.
 We're not coming over there.
 You come over here like you said you would.
 So, is it Shauna and the girls at the lake house this weekend?
 - Shauna?
 - Oh, fuck.
 I No.
 Now, there is one thing that every girl in the whole world whose name is Shanna has in common with each other.
 We all hate the name
"Shauna,
" and we really hate it when people call us
"Shauna.

" Just remember it's
"Shanna Banana,
" not
"Shauna Banauna.

" Okay, but at some point in the evening, I had fuckability stock.
 Yeah, I mean, it wasn't bullish, but Okay Warren's sending over shots, and you know the house rules.
 If he sends over shots, you gotta do them.
 - What?
 - Hey, them's the rules, baby.
 - Warren says it, we do it!
 I love that philosophy!

"Warren says it, we do it.

" So let's do it!
 What is it?
 Hey, shot first, questions later.
 Here we go.
 Post time!
 Mmm!
 Whoo-hoo!
 Now, is that a tasty beverage or is that a tasty beverage?
 What the fuck is it?
!
 Chartreuse.
 The only liquor so good they named a color after it.
 Who's down for dos Chartreuse?
 Not me.
 I'm going out for a smoke.
 Okay, but careful where you keep that hot flame, all right?
 You 'll blow up the joint.
 Drinks.
 What can we get you?
 Shanna Banana?
 Another big-ass Long Island iced tea.
 Bombay Sapphire and tonic with no ice.
 Good boy.
 Oh, hey, Punky.
 Uh, one of the lights is off in the parking lot.
 Flip it.
 - Oh!
 Jesus Christ!
 - Whoa-ho!
 You scared the fuck out of me, you shitty asshole!
 I swear, Arlene.
 I was not trying to scare you.
 I just got lucky.
 Oh, hardee-fucking-har.
 - Let's go inside.
 - Wait a minute.
 - Why?
 - I was thinkin' we could make out.
 What, on a porch?
 Not even in the bar, but in front of the entrance?
 - Forget it.
 - No, in my car.
 What, out there?
 It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.
 Not in my car it's not.
 Look, you won't get wet.
 I promise you.
 You know, most guys wouldn't brag about that.
 Ha ha ha.
 I mean you know what I mean.
 Look, I know you guys are going to Lake L.
B.
J.
 and we can't come.
 I wanna make out Okay, just stop with the whining.
 It's not attractive.
 I don't want it super fucking obvious to everybody in the bar we've been gone, - so we'll make out for six minutes, deal?
 - Great.
 No, no, no.
 Deal or no deal?
 If you're gonna whine when I pull the plug in six minutes, we could just walk back inside the fucking bar right now.
 - Deal.
 No whining.
 - And no begging.
 And no begging.
 When you say
"done,
" it's done.
 I'm gonna remember you said that.
 Okay, let's go.
 Oh, you got two jobs kiss good and make sure my hair don't get wet.
 It was early, early one morning When I heard my bulldog bark It was Staggolee and Billy Lyons Squabblin ' in the dark Now, look, you can't look like you're trying to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up, but you've got to get her out of here before Christian Simonson shows up.
 Yeah, but what's the point?
 They're going to Shanna's daddy's house at Lake L.
B.
J.
, and it's no guys.
 Absolutely no guys.
 Okay.
 So after we bring the girls' drinks, in fairly rapid order, but not obvious, we order two more rounds of shots.
 You think they're gonna fall for that?
 We'll be very convincing.
 Now it's time to turn up the volume.
 No more fucking around.
 We go to Jäger shots.
 Man, they're not gonna drink Jäger shots.
 Dude, as long as a guy's buying the booze, a fucking bitch will drink anything.
 Come on, dude, we can at least get one shot of Jäger down these fucking bitches' throats.
 After that, we'll see if they get another Jäger shot in them.
 You never know.
 That could be the shot that puts them past the point of
"fuck it.

" Then all of a sudden
"no guys at the lake house
" turns into a couple of guys at the lake house.
 My point exactly.
 And I know I can at least get
"Shanna Suck-my-banana
" to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.
 What's Julia's sweet shot?
 - Key Lime Pie.
 - Oh, come on, dude.
 Even fucking Leroy Brown would do one more for dessert.
 Dude, check it out.
 I wonder if B.
J.
 brought the bear with him.
 Jesus.
 Dude fucking cut himself falling out of his time machine.
 Hi, could I get a chicken suit for Stroker Ace, please?
 See the hole I shot in his head The high sheriff told the deputy Get your pistols and come with me We got to go arrest a bad man Known as Staggolee They laid them on the shelf If you want that bad man Staggolee You'll have to arrest him yourself The high sheriff asked the bartender And where did you two disappear to?
 I had to get something out of the car, and Nate was gentlemanly enough to escort me with his umbrella.
 Ah, good for you, Nate.
 You see that pretty girl sitting by herself at the bar?
 Who, the dirty hippie?
 Meow.
 She's not a hippie.
 She might as well be a hippie.
 Thank you, Timmy boy.
 Well, do you know what just happened to her?
 No, but I know she's a skinny, fake, blonde bitch.
 Oh, I'm sorry.
 You were telling a story?
 What about her?
 Hey, Warren!
 Is there anybody you could vouch for to give me a ride home?
 Fair lady, your chariot awaits.
 You've been eavesdropping?
 There's eavesdropping and
"can't help but hear.

" I think I belong in the latter category.
 So, uh, Icy Hot.
 You're offering me a ride home?
 I'm offering you a lift if when I'm ready to leave, you are, too.
 And when are you thinking about leaving?
 Truthfully, I'm not thinking about it.
 But when I do, you will be the first to know.
 Will you be able to, uh, drive later?
 I know looks can be deceiving.
 But I'm a teetotaler.
 I've been drinking club soda and lime all night, and now I'm building up to my big drink.
 - Which is what?
 - Virgin piña colada.
 Okay.
 Why would someone who doesn't drink spend hours at a bar drinking water?
 You know, a bar offers all kind of things other than alcohol.
 Mmm.
 Really?
 Like what?
 Women.
 Nacho grande platters.
 The fellowship of some fascinating individuals, like Warren here.
 Alcohol is just a lubricant for all the individual encounters that a barroom offers.
 Ooh.
 Is that cowboy wisdom?
 I'm not a cowboy, Pam.
 I'm a stuntman.
 But that's a very easy mistake to make.
 How do you know my name?
 When you were talking with Warren couldn't help but overhear.
 Fair enough.
 So what's your name, Icy?
 Stuntman Mike.
 Stuntman Mike's your name?
 Tsk.
 You ask anybody.
 Hey, Warren.
 Who is this guy?
 Stuntman Mike.
 And who the hell is Stuntman Mike?
 He's a stuntman.
 Warren!
 Six shots of Wild Turkey!
 I' ve just got to know Should I go leave And find somebody else You know I stood yesterday Yeah!
 Yeah!
 Let's do 'em!
 Salud.
 Down the snatch.
 You know, Pam, I think it's time for my big drink.
 Well, Stuntman Mike, since I have a tab here, can I buy you that virgin piña colada?
 Thank you, Pam.
 That'd be lovely.
 Warren!
 A, uh, virgin piña colada for my stuntman friend and I'll have another Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.
 Cabo Wabo, virgin.
 People, I've been misled And I've been afraid I've been hit in the head And left for days I've been abused And I've been accused I've been refused A piece of bread - Ah!
 - Hey, if it ain't Lanna-Frank.
 Mwah.
 - Hey, baby.
 - How are you?
 - In my life before - Hey, what's up?
 Hey!
 Hey, what's shakin', bacon?
 Hey.
 Go wrong as I do today - I want you to stop - Well, let's scootch over, now.
 It's about fucking time.
 Well, beggars can't be choosers.
 Take a picture.
 It lasts longer.
 What?
 That table.
 Seems to keep, um, getting your attention.
 Is that the girl from the billboard outside?
 Yep.
 She sure is a striking-looking woman.
 It's got gin, tequila, Jäger Look at that hair.
 Lots of leave-in conditioner.
 Is that jealousy I detect?
 Hardly.
 But if you want to get with, uh, Jungle Julia, there's a real easy way to do that.
 Really, what would that be?
 Get famous.
 You won't have to find her she'll find you.
 And you don't even want to know what she did for that billboard.
 Enjoy it, cocksucker.
 You've earned it.
 What did she ever do to you?
 We went to school together from kindergarten through high school.
 That's what she did to me.
 She was her height right now at 12.
 She was a monster.
 Half the guys she still fucks she used to terrorize in the fifth grade.
 And she used to beat you up and take your chocolate milk, huh?
 That pituitary case?
 Might have kicked my ass a couple of times sorry, I'm built like a girl, not a black man but I'd die before I ever gave Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.
 Hey!
 Are you famous or somethin'?
 Or somethin'.
 No, no, no.
 Really.
 Hey, what do what do you do?
 Really?
 What I do is work my ass off to get my own record label off the ground, but why that girl wanted a picture of me is because I'm a local D.
J.
 Wait a minute.
 You've got a billboard by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?
 Yeah.
 I got one there, too, Zatoichi.
 Yeah.
 Jungle Julia Lucai.
 Stuntman Mike McKay.
 Well.
 Good to meet you, Stuntman Mike.
 My friends and I are going to continue to get our weed on.
 Would you care for some?
 Thank you, Julia, but just the same no thanks.
 - Suit yourself.
 - But you know Oh, shit.
 Ah!
 My God.
 Sorry.
 It's nothing.
 What the fuck was that?
 You got some voucher here.
 I asked him what movies you worked on.
 No fuckin' clue.
 Well, technically I really don't know if he's ever done anything for sure.
 I mean, he shows me an episode of High Chaparral, a guy falls off a horse, he says it's him.
 You know the show The Virginian?
 Yeah, well, there was another actor on that show, Gary Clarke, and I looked like him a bit well, obviously before I cut myself shaving.
 Tsk.
 Aww, I like it.
 Well, damn, if you ain't so sweet you make sugar taste just like salt.
 Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians doubling Gary Clarke.
 And, uh then that show turned into The Men of Shiloh, they brought on Lee Majors, and I doubled him.
 From that point on I specialized mostly in car stunts.
 Yeah, I did damn near the whole third season of Vega$.
 I was Robert Urich's driving double.
 And then Bob did another show, Gavilan.
 and he brought me with him on that, till And after that Do you know any of these shows or people I'm talkin' about?
 Sorry.
 - No?
 - Mm-mm.
 No, no.
 So how exactly does one become a stuntman, Stuntman Mike?
 Well, in Hollywood, anybody fool enough to throw himself down a flight of stairs can usually find somebody to pay him for it.
 But really I got into the business the way most people get into the stunt business.
 How's that?
 - My brother got me in it.
 - Well, who's your brother?
 Stuntman Bob.
 I'm ready to blaze!
 Finally, yeah.
 You need to catch up with us.
 - Now the party can start.
 - Yep.
 Anywho, I'm sorry.
 You forgive me?
 But you have to be real nice to me for the whole rest of the time I'm here.
 Promise.
 You ready to go to the lake?
 Mm-hmm.
 - How about your friend, bring him?
 - I thought no boys.
 If you really want him to come, Shanna won't mind.
 So how about it?
 Boys or just us girls?
 Mmm, us girls.
 Good idea.
 Ladies?
 Thanks.
 Cheers, Butterfly.

"The woods are lovely, dark, and deep
"And I have promises to keep, And miles to go before I sleep.

" Did you hear me, Butterfly?

"Miles to go before you sleep.

" Sorry, Stuntman Burt Mike.
 Mike.
 She already broke off that dance.
 Is that true?
 Did I miss my chance?
 Do I frighten you?
 Is it my scar?
 It's your car.
 Ah, yeah, I know.
 Sorry.
 It's my mom's car.
 Have you been following us?
 No, but that's what I love about Austin it's just so damn small.
 - You've seen this guy before?
 - I saw him outside of Guero's.
 And I saw you outside Guero's, too.
 You saw my car, I saw your legs.
 Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all, but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.
 So you really weren't following us?
 I'm not following you, Butterfly.
 I just got lucky.
 So, how about that lap dance?
 Sorry, it was a one-time only offer, and she did it earlier this evening at Antone's.
 - No, she didn't.
 - How do you know?
 I'm good that way.
 - Tsk.
 And you look a little touchéd.
 - What's
"touchéd
"?
 Wounded, slightly.
 Why should I be wounded?
 Because you expected guys to be pestering you all night, but from your look I can tell nobody pestered you at all.
 That kind of hurt your feelings a little bit, didn't it?
 There are few things as fetching as a bruised ego on a beautiful angel.
 So How about that lap dance?
 I think I'm going to have to give you a rain check.
 Well, since you'll be leaving in the next couple of days, that rain check'll be worthless.
 But that's okay.
 I understand if I make you uncomfortable.
 You're still a nice girl.
 And I still like you.
 But I must warn you of something.
 You know how people say,
"You're okay in my book,
" or,
"In my book, that's no good.

" Well, I actually have a book.
 And everybody I ever meet goes in this book.
 And now I've met you, and you're goin' in the book.
 Except I'm afraid I must file you under
"Chicken Shit.

" And what if I did it?
 Well, I definitely couldn't file you under
"Chicken Shit,
" then, now, could I?
 What's your name again?
 - Stuntman Mike.
 - Well, Stuntman Mike I'm Butterfly.
 My friend Jungle Julia over here says that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.
 Yeah, it is.
 Yeah.
 Well, why don't you go get ready for your lap dance?
 What about
"kind of cute, kind of hot, kind of sexy,
"hysterically funny but not funny-looking guy who you could fuck
" did you not understand?
 Aah, aah Aah, aah Now, down in Mexicali There's a pretty little place that I love Where the drinks are hotter than the chili sauce And the boss is a cat named Joe He wears a red bandanna Plays a cool piano In a honky-tonk down in Mexico He wears a purple sash And a black moustache In a honky-tonk down in Mexico Well The first time that I saw him He was a-sitting on a piano stool I said,
"Tell me, then, when does the fun begin?

" He just winked his eye and said,
"Man, be cool
" He wears a red bandanna Plays a blues piano In a honky-tonk down in Mexico He wears a purple sash And a black moustache In a honky-tonk down in Mexico In Mexico All of a sudden, in walks a chick In Mexico Joe starts playing on a Latin kick In Mexico Around her waist she wore three fishnets In Mexico She started dancing with the castanets In Mexico I didn't know just what to expect In Mexico She threw her arms around my neck In Mexico We started dancing all around the floor In Mexico And then she did a dance I never saw before So if you're south of the border I mean a-down in a-Mexico And you wanna get straight, man, don't hesitate Just look up a cat named Joe He wears a red bandanna Plays a blues piano In a honky-tonk down in Mexico He wears a purple sash And a black moustache In a honky I'm driving.
 We're gonna go somewhere else, gonna go hang out.
 Ready to go?
 Yeah.
 - Bye.
 Bye.
 I think you got Mike laid tonight.
 Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!
 He's just giving me a ride.
 Oh, no doubt.
 Have a nice ride!
 Look, double fucks.
 I am not gonna fuck him.
 I can hear you.
 - He's old enough to be my dad.
 - I can still hear you.
 Bye.
 Bye-bye!
 Wow, that's fucking scary.
 Yeah, well, I wanted it to be impressive and scary tends to impress.
 Is it safe?
 No, it's better than safe.
 It's death-proof.
 How do you make a car death-proof?
 Well, that's what stuntmen do.
 You've seen a movie where a car gets into some smash-up there ain't no way in hell anybody's walking away from?
 Yeah.
 Well, how do you think they accomplish that?
 CGI?
 Well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays more often than not, you're right.
 Tsk.
 But back in the all-or-nothin' days Vanishing Point days, the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days, the White Line Fever days real cars smashing into real cars.
 Real dumb people driving 'em.
 So, give the stunt team the car you want to smash up, they take her and reinforce that fucker everywhere and Voila!
 You got yourself a death-proof automobile.
 That makes sense.
 I just didn't know you could make a car death-proof.
 Well, I can drive this baby into a brick wall doing 125 miles an hour.
 Just for the experience.
 Why is your passenger seat in a box?
 Well, this is a movie car.
 Sometimes when you're shootin' a crash, director wants to put a camera in the car you know, shoot the crash from the inside.
 That's where you put the camera.
 They call it a
"crash box.

" There you go.
 You know, when you asked to drive me home, you didn't mention your car didn't have a passenger seat.
 Yeah, well, actually, I didn't ask to drive you home.
 You asked me for a ride, and I said,
"Yes.

" But look at the bright side, Pam I won't be gettin' fresh, putting my hand on your knee.
 That is a bright side.
 I thought so.
 Well, Pam which way are you going?
 - Left or right?
 - Right.
 Ah, that's too bad.
 Why?
 Well, because it was a 50/50 shot on whether you 'd be going left or right.
 You see, we're both going left.
 You could have just as easily been going left, too, and if that was the case, it would have been a while before you started getting scared.
 But since you're going the other way, I'm afraid you're gonna have to start getting scared immediately.
 What the fuck?
!
 Cocksucking motherfucker!
 Just fucking let me out of here!
 I'll fucking rip your fucking Stop the fucking car!
 Why are you being such a shit?
 Okay.
 Here's the thing.
 I get it.
 I I know it's a joke, and super funny.
 Um, but if you just stop right now, you know, and and let me out, I'll never tell anybody because I know it's a joke.
 I know all about jokes.
 Ha ha ha!
 I promise everything'll be fine.
 Just just just let me out.
 Please?
 - And and and - Hey, Pam!
 Remember when I said this car was death proof?
 Well, that wasn't a lie.
 This car is 100% death proof.
 Only to get the benefit of it, honey you really need to be sittin' in my seat.
 Now I gotta catch me my other girlfriends.
 No, no, no, no, no, no.
 It's Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick and Tich.
 So, you got it?
 Thanks, honey.
 You're gonna play it next song, right?
 Good boy.
 Growl!
 Bye-bye.
 Who do you want to hear?
 Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
 Who?
 Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, and Tich.
 Who the fuck are they?
 For your information, Pete Townshend, at one point, almost quit The Who, and if he had, he would have ended up in this group, thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick, Tich, and Pete.
 And if you ask me, he should have.
 That's my boy!
 Hold tight, count to three Gotta stay close by me And hold tight, sing and shout Just ride my roundabout And hold tight, shut your eyes Girl, you suit me for size Forget the other guys You'll never fall each time you call Hold tight, hold tight Hold tight Hold tight, make me feel, what you say is for real And hold tight, carousel Girl, you'll soon ring my bell And hold tight, we will fly Swinging low, swinging high We're gonna make the sky You'll never fall I want to hear this part of the song louder!
 Do you remember anything?
 Uh I I don't remember.
 Doctor Block.
 Self-restraints to Room 310.
 Self-restraints to Room 310.
 Well.
 What's the patient's prognosis, Dr.
 Block?
 I don't really see it's any of your business.
 Come on now, Sis.
 You just tell us.
 How bad is he?
 He got banged up real good.
 Busted nose, broken collarbone, smashed up his left index finger.
 Is that it?
 He was real lucky.
 That'll be all?
 Well, that's more than enough, and I wanna thank you, Dr.
 Block.
 Son of a bitch.
 So, Pop.
 What do you think?
 Well, Son Number One, what I think is so goddamn ghoulish I hesitate to speak it out loud.
 Well, give it a shot.
 Well, what we have here is a case of vehicular homicide.
 That ol' boy in there murdered them pretty little gals.
 I mean, he used a car, not a hatchet, but they're dead just the same.
 Well, what are you gonna do?
 Not a goddamn thing.
 D.
A.
 says there ain't no crime here.
 Every one of them gals was swimming in alcohol and floatin' on weed, and old Hooper in there came out clean as a whistle.
 Now, you actually think that he premeditatively murdered them gals?
 Well, I can't prove it.
 But since thinkin' don't cost nothin', I can think it, and I do.
 Yeah, but Pop, he got pretty banged up himself.
 Well, hell yeah, he got banged up, but goddamn I mean, them pretty little gals in there look like a goddamn giant chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.
 Did any of 'em survive?
 Shit.
 Two tons of metal, 200 miles an hour, flesh and bone and plain old Newton they all princess died.
 Why?
 Well, I'd guesstimate it's a sex thing.
 The only way I can figure it.
 High-velocity impact, twisted metal, busted glass, all four souls taken exactly the same time.
 Probably the only way that diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo.
 Yeah, I think the only thing we can dream of getting that bastard on is vehicular manslaughter for the hitchhiker in the death box.
 That was just plain old, goddamn reckless endangerment.
 But I got me a goddamn bartender gonna testify that ol' Stuntman Mike didn't drink a drop all night.
 And his passenger was left stranded by her date, in the goddamn rain, no less, and she asked him for the fucking ride.
 Now, on paper, this is gonna look like he was just trying to help her out.
 I mean, that's the way the jury's gonna see it.
 So, what are you gonna do, Pop?
 Tsk.
 Well, I could take it upon myself to work the case, Search for evidence, you know, prove my theory.
 Alert authorities.
 Dog that rotten son of a bitch wherever he goes, I go.
 Or I could spend the same goddamn amount of time and energy following the NASCAR circuit.
 Hmm.
 I've thought about it a lot.
 I think I'd have a hell of a lot happier life if I did the latter.
 And just because I can't punish Old Frankenstein in there for what he's done, I'm gonna tell you like the Lord told John if he ever does it again, I can make goddamn sure he don't do it in Texas.
 You know you're sliding down Against your heart Yeah, you got one Just close your eyes So you can see So you can see No, baby, I don 't care What they say, it's so easy No, baby, I don 't care What they say, it's so easy Yeah, it's comin' on It's getting sweeter And sweeter If you're gonna drown Then do it the right way The right way I don't care what they say, it's so easy I don't care what they say, it's so Are you on the same floor as him?
 No, he's on the fourth.
 - And who's in whose room?
 - He's in mine.
 And so what happened then?
 We made out for about ten minutes, and then I sent him off to his room.
 - So how's the Rock as a kisser?
 - Mm, he's damn good.
 He's got them mushy lips, smooth fingertips.
 Mm, I love them mushy lips.
 He's a big guy, so he spins me around so my back is up against him, takes his big hand and puts it on my throat, tilts my head back and leans over me, kisses me from behind.
 Damn, that sounds sexy!
 It was sexy.
 But then that was it?
 You sent him off?
 How'd he take it?
 Wait a minute, what are we doing here?
 If I'm gonna power through and pick up Zoë at the airport, I need coffee.
 Since you're getting that, can you get some more vodka and sugar-free Red Bull?
 We didn't know you were awake.
 I'm not awake.
 I'm asleep.
 But get some more vodka and some sugar-free Red Bull anyway.
 And some Red Apple Tans.
 Damn, I didn't stop to get you bitches groceries.
 - You remember how to get to the airport?
 Uh-huh.
 Then you should get behind the wheel, 'cause you gonna drive.
 Motherfuckers.
 They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.
 They got regular Red Bull and sugar-free G.
O.
 juice.
 G.
O.
 G.
O.
!
 It's not the way you kiss that says you're mine Many, many, many nights go by I sit alone at home and cry over you What can I do Don't want nobody, nobody 'Cause, baby, it's you Is it true what they say All about you They say you'll never ever never be true It doesn't matter what they say I know I'm gonna love you any old way What would I do Without you I don't want nobody Where the hell are my keys?
 Here they are.
 Sorry, I didn't mean to give you a concert there.
 No, it wasn't you.
 That guy bumped into my feet when he walked by.
 I don't know why, but that kind of creeped me out.
 I don't care what they saying to me Little dick.
 Clearly.
 Since I'm up, I might as well hit the ATM.
 Get me a fuckin' smoke.
 What?
 Did you just see the What?
 Nothing, honey.
 Y'ello.
 It's me.
 Miss me?
 You best get your ass off Kim's car.
 - I've seen Kim sit on it before.
 - Her ass ain't your ass.
 Okay.
 So, I think I'm in this month's issue of Allure.
 You got Allure?
 Magazines by the window.
 Here you are!
 You hot mama, you.
 See you in a second.
 $3.
85 out of 20.
 And you get 16 and change back.
 Thank you very much.
 You know, I got other fashion magazines for sale behind the counter.
 No, that's okay.
 This'll be all.
 Thought I'd ask.
 - Thanks anyway.
 - Have a good one.
 I got this month's issue of Italian Vogue.
 This month's?
 Listen to this.
 The Circle A clerk has this month's issue of Italian Vogue.
 - No way.
 - Way!
 I can't believe fuckin' Circle A carries Italian Vogue.
 It doesn't.
 It's his own personal copy.
 He'll let it go for 27 bucks.
 27 bucks?
 What the fuck do you care?
 We're talking about per diem here.
 We found an issue of Italian Vogue in Lebanon, Tennessee.
 We're lucky he's not asking for fuckin' Krugerrands.
 I'm getting it, and we're splitting it three ways.
 What, me, you, and Kim?
 Kim doesn't give a shit about Italian Vogue.
 but Brandy'll come in with us, and if she won't, Tisla, her sister, will.
 Okay, but if anybody tears out any sheets I want, you gotta make color Xeroxes of those pages, and I'm not talking Kinko's.
 You take it to the art department and have them do it fuckin' right.
 Whoo!
 Oh, my God!
 Got it!
 the actress Oh, boy.
 Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë.
 It just so happens we're all three off-duty for the next three days.
 Fuckin' hell!
 How does that happen?
 I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup, and she's off for the next three days.
 There's no stunts being filmed during that time so Kim's free, and Lee's on a will-notify for the four days.
 So how's the shoot going?
 Great.
 We're having the best time.
 The director, Cecil Evans, is so fun.
 We're making the coolest movie and partying all the time.
 Hell, yeah.
 The next job after this one is definitely gonna suck.
 So let's hear it, ladies.
 Set romances!
 Who's getting it off?
 That would be Lee and Toolbox.
 Oh, Toolbox!
 Name sounds promising.
 - He's a grip.
 - What he is is a pervert.
 Well, he just keeps sounding better and better.
 What's his perversion?
 He likes to watch me pee.
 Lee is sitting on a toilet and Toolbox is watching her pee P-I-S-S-I-N-G Ooh!
 Yeah, but not no more.
 Now she's getting it on with the Rock.
 You had a one-off with the Rock?
 Well, not the real Rock.
 He's this electrician named Bruce.
 He looks like the Rock, so we all just call him the Rock.
 Oh, yeah, this is an all-star crew.
 We got a guy who looks like Nic Cage and Pee Wee Herman, too.
 Kim, dick department.
 Let's hear it!
 Mm-mmm, no dick this trip.
 I got a man.
 - How long have you had this boyfriend?
 - About three months.
 Who'd you steal him from?
 Nobody!
 Kim!
 - Wha what?
 He totally had a girlfriend.
 All of Kim's boyfriends start out as somebody else's boyfriend.
 I did not steal him!
 I didn't steal any of them; they just jumped ship.
 - So what's your story, Abernathy?
 - Oh, Abbie's got the big Kahuna.
 I had a set crush on Cecil.
 Set crush?
 Nigga, please.
 You were his set wife!

"Were
" and
"had
" being the key words, here.
 Bitch, you two are still into each other and you know it.
 Yeah, well, if he's so in love with me, why did he fuck Darryl Hannah's stand-in?
 Yes, men are dogs.
 Oh, it's so funny!
 Oh, it's so funny!
 Stop acting all hurt.
 Your ass just mad.
 Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.
 You need to get over that shit.
 That was two weeks ago.
 Oh, well, now you put it like that Oh, I haven't told you the best part.
 He fucked her on my birthday.
 Oh, that's a horse of a different color.
 - Thank you.
 - Did he know it was your birthday?
 I mean, he's the director.
 He's kind of busy.
 He ate a piece of my birthday cake, and he got me a present.
 - Wow.
 - Yeah I think he knew.
 What did he get you?
 He made me a tape.
 He made you a tape?
 Wait, he didn't burn you a CD?
 He made you a tape?
 - Yeah.
 - Oh, that is so romantic!
 Yes, I know what you're gonna say, so don't even go there.
 This sounds like the test of true love to me.
 Look, I know you guys like him.
 He's likeable.
 But he fucked another woman on my birthday.
 How can you not be on my side?
 I admit, that sounds bad.
 It is bad!
 It just sounds like there's a little more to it than that.
 Were you two fucking?
 Hell, no.
 Hello, is your name Abernathy?
 Sorry.
 The answer to your question is no, of course not.
 What do you mean
"No, of course not
"?
 The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend in six years is because girls will fuck him, and if you fuck Cecil, you don't become one of his girlfriends not to say I want to be his girlfriend, but if I did want to be his girlfriend, if I fucked him, I wouldn't be.
 I'd be one of his regulars, and I'm getting too fuckin' old for that shit.
 - Have you let him do anything?
 - Yes!
 I've let him give me a foot massage, and when we go to the movies, I've let him hold my hand.
 Bitch, you might be actin' like you 12 years old, but he just acting like a man.
 You need to break that nigga off a piece.
 Let me get this straight you're not fucking him, you're not sucking him, you're not giving him any tongue, but Darryl Hannah's stand-in is?
 Can we just take my sex life off the table?
 Actually, it was Cecil's sex life that was on the table and your lack of one.
 Fuck both of you and your little high-five.
 Before you can claim a nigga, you got to claim a nigga, and you can start by giving that motherfucker a hand job in the back of the van on Tuesday.
 I'm not gonna do that!
 I know you won't!
 But you know who will the bitch that ends up living in that big-ass mansion of his.
 I haven't entirely agreed with everything Kim's said, but it is true if you've stretched it out like you have with Cecil and you suddenly get dirty on them, it blows their mind.
 So Zoë, Kim, and I are in the Philippines at an outdoor rave.
 What were you working on?
 - Three Kicks to the Head.
 Part Three.
 And, admittedly, we're a little fucked up.
 Cheers to that.
 - Word.
 Cheers.
 So Zoë the genius, wants to take a picture of me.
 It's dark as hell, and you can't see shit.
 So she's got her camera and keeps saying,
"Step back a little!

" So I do.
 Then
"A little fu-ther!

" So I step back a little fu-ther.
 Then
"A little more!

" So I do.
 Then I realize I'm at the edge of a seven-foot concrete ditch with God knows how many rocks and broken bottles and rats in it, and if I fell in that fucking thing, I probably would have broken my neck.
 So I am yelling at her:
"Zoë, you almost killed me!

" So we laugh about it and walk a little further, and Zoë starts fuckin' around.
 And bam!
 if she doesn't fall in the fucking ditch!
 Nice.
 Thank you.
 Yep.
 Thank you.
 I remember taking a step and looking down, just as I'm thinking,
"There's that ditch Abbie was talking about.

" Bam!
 I'm in the fucking ditch, you know.
 What happened?
 What, with Zoë, the cat?
 Nothing.
 If I fell in that fuckin' thing, they would have had to helicopter me out of there.
 Zoë just lands on her feet.
 But then later I started feeling a little bad about myself Zoë falls in the ditch and it's nothing.
 We're laughing about it.
 If I fell in that fucking thing, I probably would have been paralyzed.
 Oh, honey, you can't think like that.
 We all have our individual talents, and that just happens to be one of Zoë's.
 Well, physically speaking, Zoë is amazing.
 I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness?
 There's few human beings that can fuck with Zoë on that front.
 Kim, I like you too.
 Having said that, before you get too envious of Zoë's prowess, you 're missing the most important part of that story.
 You didn't fall in the ditch.
 Zoë did.
 Zoë even knew there was a ditch there because you told her, and she still fell in.
 So Lee's right.
 We all have our talents.
 Hey, I resemble that remark.
 So Kim, you still pack a Roscoe?
 Check it out, bitch.
 - Ooh, nice one, mate.
 - I know this.
 What's a Roscoe?
 Roscoe's a pistol.
 - You carry a gun?
 - Uh-huh.
 You have a license to carry?
 Yeah, when I became a Secret Service agent, they gave me a license.
 Oh, I didn't know you were Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
 Stop looking at me.
 God.
 Did you know Kim carried a gun?
 Yes.
 Now, do I approve?
 No.
 Do I know?
 Yes.
 Look, I don't know what futuristic utopia you live in, but the world I live in, a bitch need a gun.
 You can't get around the fact that people who carry guns tend to get shot more than people who don't.
 And you can't get around the fact that if I go down to the laundry room at midnight enough times, I might get my ass raped.
 Don't do your laundry at midnight.
 Fuck that!
 I wanna do my laundry whenever the fuck I want to.
 There are other things you can carry other than a gun.
 Pepper spray.
 Uh, motherfucker trying to rape me, I don't want to give him a skin rash.
 I wanna shut that nigga down!
 How about a knife, at least?
 Yeah, you know what happens to motherfuckers carry knives?
 They get shot!
 If I ever become a famous actress, I won't carry a gun.
 I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga and he'll carry the gun, and when shit goes down, I'll sit back and laugh, but until that day, it's Wild West.
 So Zoë, you thought about what you want to do first?
 It just so happens I know exactly what I want to do.
 Oh, really?
 And what would that be?
 To me, there's no point in being in America unless you can drive a Detroit muscle car.
 I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger fuck me swinging, balls out.
 Well, I guess we could talk to Transpo, but does it have to be a Dodge Challenger?
 Not just that.
 It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine.
 How in the fuck do you expect to do that?
 No worries, mate.
 I've got it all worked out.
 When I knew I was coming here, I went online and found out that the local paper here in Tennessee is the Lebanon News Sentinel.
 - So back home - I'm sorry, where's home?
 Australia?
 What do you mean by that, mate?
 Zoë's from New Zealand, and you never I repeat, never call a Kiwi an Aussie.
 That is, unless you want your ass kicked.
 I'm so sorry.
 I will nev Oh, it's okay.
 We're just taking the piss out of you, mate.
 Auckland, to answer your question.
 Anyway, I subscribed to the local paper a month ago.
 Why the fuck you want a local redneck newspaper in New Zealand?
 Pipe down and I'll tell you.
 I've been getting the paper and checking the classifieds, looking at cars for sale, so as of yesterday, for sale in this town, some dude is selling a stock 1970 Dodge Challenger with a 440 engine and a white paint job.
 And you wanna buy it?
 Kim, I may be stupid, but I'm not bloody stupid.
 I wanna say I wanna buy it so he'll let me test-drive it.
 A 1970 Dodge Challenger with a white paint job?
 Oh, uh, Kowalski!
 Kowalski from Vanishing Point.
 Mate, it's a fucking classic!
 If I can get this guy to let me drive it without him, I will blow the doors off that bitch.
 What's Vanishing Point?
 What's Vanishing Point?
 Abs, I'm supposed to be the illiterate one.
 It's just one of the best American movies ever made.
 Actually, Zoë, most girls wouldn't know Vanishing Point.
 Excuse me.
 Most girls?
 What the fuck are you two?
 Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
 Of course we watched it.
 Y'all grew up watching that Pretty in Pink shit.
 Oh, I liked Pretty in Pink.
 What, so you didn't watch John Hughes movies?
 Of course I did.
 I'm a girl.
 But I also watched car shit, too Vanishing Point.
 Dirty Mary Crazy Larry.
 - Gone in 60 Seconds - Oh The real one, not that Angelina Jolie bullshit.
 We have an outdoor theater in Auckland that plays Vanishing Point.
 Big Wednesday, all the classics.
 What do you horny gals want?
 Yeah, you got a 1970 Dodge Challenger for sale?
 Right up here, ladies.
 This shit is off the fuckin' hook!
 Fuckin' legendary, mate.
 Sweet ass.
 Well, if you 'll excuse me, I'd like to have a word with my associate.
 You ladies take your time.
 What are you waiting for?
 Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.
 I intend to, but first I need to ask you something.
 What?
 If he lets us take it out on our own, I wanna play Ship's Mast.
 - Oh, hell, no!
 - Keep it down!
 Ain't no way I'm doing Ship's Mast.
 - For Chrissakes - Don't blaspheme.
 Sorry.
 Now, what did you say after the last time?
 - Look, I know what I said.
 - What did you say?
 - I know I said we shouldn't - No.
 You didn't say we shouldn't.
 You said we ain't ever gonna do that again.
 - But - But, my ass!
 You said not only are we never gonna play Ship's Mast again, but you also said if you ever do what you trying to do now, to not only refuse, but that I had permission to physically restrain your ass if necessary.
 Now, did you or did you not say that?
 No, no, no.
 Answer the question, motherfucker.
 - Did you or did you not say that?
 - Yes, I said that.
 - However - Whatever with your
"however.

" Look, I know I said it, and I know I meant it Damn skippy you meant it!
 But when I said it, I didn't mean in America!
 - Oh, nigga, please.
 - For real.
 Really.
 I meant we should never play Ship's Mast again in New Zealand or Australia.
 You are such a liar!
 I know what I said, but when I said it I didn't know I'd ever come to America, and if I had of known I was gonna come to America, had the opportunity to play Ship's Mast on the Vanishing Point Challenger I would have added a
"however.

" Right?
 Okay, oddly enough, I actually understood that.
 However, just because you talked yourself into some stupid shit doesn't mean I have lost my goddamn mind.
 You need two people to play Ship's Mast, and I ain't playing.
 I'll be your best friend.
 I don't need me no best friend lives on the other side of Planet Earth.
 I'll crack your back.
 You'll crack it anyway.
 Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.
 But now, while I'm here, I'll be your back-cracking slave.
 Whenever you want it, you've got it.
 You don't even have to ask.
 You just order me to do it, just be like,
"Bitch, get over here and get busy.

" You crack my back, give me foot massages, and after a shower, you moisturize my butt.
 Deal.
 We're gonna see if this guy'll let us take the car out without him.
 If he does, you wait here with Lee and we'll be back in a moment.
 What?
 - I said we're gonna see if this guy'll let - I heard what you said.
 I just can't believe what you said.
 You two got some fuckin' balls.
 What?
 Don't play dumbass with me.
 I've been up all night, I'm still a little drunk, and I have a hangover.
 I should be in my hotel room, asleep, not fuckin' around on Tobacco Road, but because Zoë wanted to drive some Vanishing Point car, I'm here.
 Now you two got the balls to ask me no, scratch that tell me I gotta go make conversation with Tom Joad while the cool kids get to go out and play?
 Bullshit on that.
 - It ain't like that.
 - What's it like, Kim?
 You guys are our collateral.
 He's never gonna go for it if we all go.
 I really think one human being will be collateral enough.
 You're not gonna want to do what we're doing.
 What, drive a car?
 We're doing more than that.
 What, drive it fast?
 We're doing more than that.
 Actually, we're paying you a compliment, 'cause we gonna do some stupid shit.
 But that's okay.
 We're stunt people.
 We ain't got good sense.
 But you got good sense, and anybody with good sense - ain't gonna want to do what we're doing.
 - How do you know?
 'Cause you're a mum.
 Yeah.
 You know, we're supposed to be this big posse, but that's the excuse you guys use whenever you want to exclude me, so what is it you two daredevils are doing that I'm just so uncool I couldn't possibly understand?
 You know, we're kind of conning this guy, so maybe it's best if we don't go into detail about it while he's watching us.
 Besides he's probably not gonna let us do it, anyway.
 Okay, how about this?
 I'll talk him into it, but I go along.
 - How you gonna do that?
 - That's my problem.
 But don't worry.
 He'll say yes.
 What are you gonna do, blow him?
 No.
 I'm gonna insinuate that Lee's gonna blow him.
 That's a good one.
 Not really.
 But let me handle it.
 We got a deal?
 Okay, Mama, listen up.
 You wanna hang with the cool kids?
 You got to be cool.
 We take you along, you don't say shit.
 You don't even say crap.
 You just sit in the back, and I don't want to hear a peep, you understand?
 - Got it.
 - I'm serious, now.
 You start nagging us, we pulling over, kicking you out, and picking you up later.
 Agreed.
 Okay.
 Go work your magic.
 - Hello, sir.
 - Hello.
 - Hello, what's your name?
 - Jasper.
 Hello, Jasper, I'm Abernathy.
 - Aber what?
 - Abernathy.
 - What's your first name?
 - That is my first name.
 - What kind of first name is that?
 - Just call me Abbie.
 Okay, Abbie.
 Jasper, we were wondering if my friends and I could take the car out for a little test drive out on our own, just to see if we're comfortable.
 Why would I do something stupid like that?
 To better sell your automobile.
 How do I know y'all ain't just gonna steal it?
 Four reasons, actually.
 One, we're not thieves, two, that would be rude, three, we're staying at the Days Inn in town you can call, check with management.
 We're registered for the next month.
 Actually, Zoë's not, but Kim and I are, so we're totally track-downable.
 Who's Kim?
 The colored girl?
 Yes.
 Kim would be the girl of color.
 And reason number four and the most important: while we're taking the car out for a little spin, that'll give you a better opportunity to get acquainted with our other friend Lee.
 Why does she look kind of familiar?
 That would be because she's a famous actress.
 Hmm.
 Why's she dressed like that?
 Well, you see, we're making a Hollywood movie in town, and it's a cheerleader movie, and she's one of the cheerleaders.
 What's a cheerleader movie?
 A movie about cheerleaders.
 Is it a porno movie?
 Yes, it is, but don't mention it.
 She's shy.
 Lee, this is Jasper.
 Jasper, Lee.
 Now, you two kids stay out of trouble.
 Hey, good-looking.
 Be back to pick you up later.
 Ta-ta!
 Gulp.
 You thinking what I'm thinking?
 I think I'm thinking it.
 What are you and you thinking?
 I'm thinking we told your ass to shut the fuck up.
 - Where y'all going?
 - You stay put.
 I gotta take a So, you ready to do this?
 You sure?
 Well, I always don't want to do it right before I'm gonna do it.
 I know what you mean, 'cause I don't wanna do it.
 Kim!
 - I'm just saying.
 - If you 're gonna take the piss out of it I'm just saying.
 You wanna start out on top?
 Practically doesn't count if you start on the top.
 Here are your gloves.
 No, no, no, no.
 I'm wearing a jacket.
 This is my jacket.
 Um, ain't you supposed to be my slave or some shit?
 - Come on.
 - I'm the one who's on the bonnet.
 Bonnet, my ass.
 You on the hood.
 Y'all, I think I hear a car coming.
 Give me your belt.
 This is my cute shit.
 Fuck that.
 Get Abernathy's belt.
 Fine, we'll use Abbie's belt.
 - Give me your belt.
 - No.
 Prada.
 Come on, give her the belt.
 - Magic word.
 - Please give her the belt?
 Just 'cause you asked nicely.
 It's nice to be nice, Kim!
 Whatever.
 You know what?
 Don't think about asking me to do your hair.
 - Your ass gonna do it.
 - You'll ask
"pretty please,
" bitch, because that's what you do when no one else is looking.
 You ain't that hard.
 - I ain't getting - Abernathy.
 Don't get on my nerves right now.
 - I got shit on my mind.
 Ooh!
 You know, I ain't six.
 It's cold.
 Can we roll up one of these windows?
 KIM and ZOË: No.
 Okay, Abernathy.
 Check this out.
 What the fuck are you guys doing?
 What does that mean?
 Whoa!
 Faster, you black bitch!
 Faster!
 That fast enough for your bony ass?
 Whoo-hoo!
 Whoa ho ho ho!

 So, where's the maniac?
 I shot him and his punk ass sped off.
 You wanna go get him?

 Motherfucker, kiss my fucking ass.
 Uhn!
 Yah!
 Mother fucker!
 Motherfucker!
 Asshole!
 Do you find me sadistic?
 Well, I bet I could fry an egg on your head right now if I wanted to.
 You know kiddo, I'd like to believe that you're aware enough even now to know that there is nothing sadistic in my actions.
 Maybe towards those other jokers, but not you.
 You know kiddo, this moment, this is me at my most non-sadistic.
 Bill, it's your baby.
  I was five and he was six.
  We rode on horses made of sticks.
  He wore black and I wore white.
  He would always win the fight.
  Bang, Bang.
 He shot me down.
  Bang, Bang.
 I hit the ground.
  Bang, Bang.
 That aweful sound.
  Bang, Bang.
 My baby shot me down.
  Seasons came and changed the time.
  When I grew up I called him mine  He would always laugh and say,  Remember when we used to play.
  Bang, Bang.
 I shot you down.
  Bang, Bang.
 You hit the ground.
  Bang, Bang.
 That aweful sound.
  Bang, Bang.
 I used to shoot you down.
  Music played and people sang.
  Just for me the church bells rang.
  Now he's gone, I don't know why.
  And till this day, sometimes I cry.
  He didn't even say good-bye,  didn't take the time to lie.
  Bang, Bang.
 He shot me down.
  Bang, Bang.
 I hit the ground.
  Bang, Bang.
 That aweful sound.
  Bang, Bang.
 My baby shot me down.
 Coming.
 -Carol, I cannot believe you are early!
 Come on bitch.
 Come on.
 Mommy, I'm home.
 Hey baby.
 How was school?
 Mommy, what happened to you and TV room?
 Oh, that little dog of yours, got his ass into the living room and acted like a damn pool.
 That's what happened baby.
 Barney did this?
 Baby, you can't come in here.
 There's broken glass everywhere.
 You could cut yourself.
 This is an old friend of mommy's I haven't seen in a long time.
 Hi honey.
 I'm ?
?
(bleep).
 What's your name?
 Her name is Nikki.
 Nikki, such a pretty name for such a pretty girl.
 How old are you Nikki?
 Nikki, ?
?
(bleep) asked you a question.
 I'm four.
 Four years old, eh.
 You know, I had a little girl once.
 She'd be about four now.
 Now baby, me and mommy's friend have grown up stuff to talk about.
 I want you to go in your room now and leave us alone till I tell you to come out.
 OK?
 Nikkia.
 In your room, now.
 You want some coffee?
 Yeah, sure.
 This Pasadena's homemaker's name is Jeanny Bell.
 Her husband is doctor Lawrence Bell.
 But back when we were acquainted four years ago, her name was Vernita Green.
 Her code name was Copperhead.
 Mine, black Mamba.
 Can I have a towel?
 Yeah.
 Thanks.
 Still take cream and sugar, right?
 Yeah.
 I suppose it's a little late for an apology, huh?
 You suppose correctly.
 Look bitch, I need to know if you're going to start any shit around my baby girl.
 You can relax for now.
 I'm not going to murder you in front of your child, OK?
 You need to be more rational because I don't know what you're capable of.
 It's mercy, compassion, and forgiveness I lack.
 Not rationality.
 I know I fucked you over.
 I fucked you over bad.
 I wish to God I hadn't, but I did.
 You have every right to get even.
 No.
 Get even?
 Even Steven?
 I would have to kill you.
 Go to Nikkie's room, kill her.
 Then wait for your husband the good doctor Bell to come home and kill him.
 That would be even Steven.
 That would leave us square.
 Look, if I could go back in a machine I would, but I can't.
 All I can tell you is that I'm a different person now.
 Oh, great.
 I don't care.
 Be that as it may, I know I don't deserve your mercy or your forgiveness.
 However, I beseech you for both what happened and for my daughter.
 Bitch.
 You can stop right there.
 Just because I have no wish to murder you before the eyes of your daughter does not mean that parading her around in front of me is going to inspire sympathy.
 You and I have unfinished business.
 And not a God damned fucking thing you've done in the subsequent 4 years, including getting knocked up, is going to change that.
 When do we do this?
 It all depends.
 When do you want to die?
 Tomorrow?
 The day after tomorrow?
 How about tonight, bitch?
 Splendid.
 Where?
 There a baseball diamond where I coach a little league about a mile from here.
 We meet there around 2:30 in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in black stocking, we'll have a knife fight.
 You won't be bothered.
 And now, I have to fix Nikki cereal.
 Bill always said you were one of the best ladies he ever saw with an edge weapon.
 Fuck you bitch.
 I know you did qualify that shit.
 So you, you can kiss my mother fucking ass just like mamba.
 Mamba.
 I should have been more like mother fucking mamba.
 It's a weapon of your choice and you can stick with your butcher knife if you want, that's fine with me.
 Very funny bitch.
 Very funny.
 It's not my intention to do this in front of you.
 For that I'm sorry.
 You can take my word for it.
 Your mother had it coming.
 When you grow up, just don't feel wrong about it.
 I'll be waiting.
 Well, give me the gory details on that one.
 It's a God damn massacre, pop.
 They wiped out the whole wedding party, execution style.
 Give me a figure.
 Nine dead bodies.
 We're talking the whole chebang.
 Bride, groom, reverendreverend's wife.
 Hell, they even shot that old colored fellow that played the organ.
 Appears to me somebody objected to the union that wasn't able to hold their piece.
 Good great green!
 What'd I tell you, pop!
 Like a God damn Nicaraguan death squad.
 This is a shit can mess of war in the house of the lord.
 Sorry pop.
 Incidentally, was a weird profession.
 My guesstimate it's a lumber hit squad.
 Four, maybe five strong.
 How can you tell?
 Well it's sure a steady hand did this.
 It ain't no squirrelly amateur.
 This was the work of a salty dog.
 You can tell by the cleanliness of the carving that killed crazy ram pig, though it may be, though cut a fine line.
 If he wasn't a moron, he'd almost get a merit.
 Who's the bride?
 Don't know.
 The name on the marriage certificate is Arlene Macuvelli.
 That's a fake.
 We've always been calling her the bride on account of her dress.
 You can tell if she's pregnant.
 The man had to be a mad dog to kill a damned good looking gal like that in the head.
 Look at her.
 A colored hair, big eyes.
 She's a blood splattered angel.
 -Son number one -Yeah.
 Call Regan.
 The cock sucker ain't dead.
 I might never have liked you.
 Quite in fact, I despise you.
 But this shouldn't suggest I don't respect you.
 Dying in our sleep is a luxury that are kinda rarely afforded.
 My giftto you.
 For God's sake!
 Hello Bill.
 What's her condition?
 Comatose.
 Where is she?
 I'm standing over her right now.
 That's my girl.
 Elle, you're going to abort the mission.
 We owe her better than that.
 No, you don't owe her shit.
 Will you keep your voice down?
 You don't owe her shit.
 May I say one thing.
 Speak.
 You all beat the hell out of that woman, but you didn't kill her.
 You put a bullet in her head but her heart just kept on beating.
 Now you saw that yourself with your own beautiful blue eye.
 Did you not?
 We've done a lot of things to this lady.
 And if she wakes up, we'll do a whole lot more.
 But one thing we won't do is sneak into her room in the night, like a filthy rat and kill her in her sleep.
 And the reason we won't do that thing is because that thing would lower us.
 Don't you agree Miss Driver?
 I guess.
 Do you really have to guess?
 No, I really don't have to guess.
 I know.
 Come on home, honey.
 Affirmative.
 I love you very much.
 I love you too.
 Bye-Bye.
 You thought that was pretty fucking funny, didn't you?
 A word of advise, shit head Don't you ever wake up.
 At this moment, this is me, in my most sadistic moment.
 Bill, it's your The price is 35 dollars a fuck, my friend.
 Think you can get the freak on or what?
 Oh yeah boy.
 Ten, twenty, thirtyyeah.
 Now here's the rules.
 Rule number one, don't punch her.
 The nurse comes in tomorrow and she's got a shiner or some less teeth, the jig's up.
 No knuckle sandwiches under no circumstances.
 And by the way, this little cunt's a spirit, it's a motor reflex thing.
 Spirit or no, no punching.
 Now are we absolutely positively clear on rule number one?
 Yeah.
 Good.
 Rule number two.
 No monkey bites or hickeys.
 In fact, don't leave no marks of no kind.
 After that, it's all good, buddy.
 There's no one down at work till tomorrow, so feel free to come back all you want.
 Keep the noise down and try not to make a mess.
 I'll be back in twenty.
 Oh shit.
 By the way, not all the times, but sometimes this chick's cooch can be as dry as a bucket of sand.
 If she's dry, lube up with this and you'll be good to go.
 Don't ask to keep it buddy.
 Oh yeah.
 God damn.
 You are the best looking girl I've had today.
 Yo, stud, time's up buddy.
 Coming in, ready or not.
 Hey buddy, did you have yourself a good time?
 Where's Bill?
 Please stop hitting me.
 I don't know who Bill is.
 Bull shit.
 She's a real slice of cutie pie they say, you know.
 Jane Doe.
 They don't know shit about you.
 I'm from Huntsville Texas.
 My name's Buck, and I'm here to fuck.
 Your name's Buck, right?
 And you came here to fuck.
 Right?
 You fucker.
 Wiggle your big toe.
 As I lay in the back of Buck's truck trying to will my limbs out of entropy.
 Wiggle your big toe.
 I could see the faces of cunts who did this to me.
 And the dick responsible.
 Members all of the Deadly Vipers Assassination Squad.
 When fortune smiles on something as violent and ugly as revenge, it seems proof like no other that not only does God exist, you're doing his will.
 At a time when I knew the least about my enemies, the first name on my death list, O-Ren Ishii was easiest to find.
 But of course when one manages the difficult task of becoming queen of the Tokyo underworld, one doesn't keep it a secret, does one?
 O-Ren Ishii was born on an American military base in Tokyo, Japan.
 The half Japanese, half Chinese American army brat made her first acquaintance with death at the age of nine.
 It was at that age that she witnessed the death of her parents at the hands of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto.
 W-h-i-m-p-e-r.
 Mommy!
 She swore revenge.
 Lucky for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile.
 At eleven, she got her revenge.
 Look at me Matsumoto.
 Look at my face.
 Take a good look at my face.
 Look at my eyes.
 Look at my mouth.
 Do I look familiar?
 Do I look like somebody.
 You murdered!
 By twenty she was one of the top female assassins in the world.
 At twenty-five she did her part in the killing of nine innocent people, including my unborn daughter, in a small wedding chapel in El Paso, Texas.
 But on that day, four years ago, she made one big mistake.
 She should have killed ten.
 However, before satisfaction be mine, First thing first, wiggle your big toe.
 Hard part's over.
 Now, let's get these other piggies wiggling.
 Welcome to Arrow.
 May I help you?
 OkinawaOne way.
 Hi.
 Welcome.
 You English?
 AlmostAmerican.
 American.
 Welcome then.
 Domo.
 My Englishvery good.
 You said domo, very good, can you speak Japanese?
 No, oh no.
 Just a few words I learned since yesterday.
 Um, may I sit at the bar?
 Oh sure sure, please, sit.
 What other words did you learn?
 Oh, excuse me.
 Shut up, get your ass out here.
 You'll excuse me.
 Ahhh what other Japanesedo you know?
 Oh, let's see.
 Arigato.
 Arigatomm Um I already said domo, right?
 Yeah.
 Oh yea yea yea.
 Konijiwa.
 Ah ah ah.
 Konichiwa.
 Ko-ni-chi-wa, please repeat.
 Konichiwa.
 Ah, that's good.
 Good, good.
 You say Japanese words like Japanese.
 -Now you're making fun of me.
 -No no no.
 See, serious business.
 Pronunciation very good.
 You say arigato, like we say arigato.
 Well thank you.
 I mean, arigato.
 You should learn Japanese.
 Very easy.
 No kidding.
 I heard it was kind of hard.
 Most of the them, but you have a Japanese tongue.
 OK OK omachikasama.
 Oh my God, I beg your pardon?
 Drink.
 Oh yes, um, a bottle of warm sake please.
 Do you understand?
 Do you understand me?
 Sorry.
 Oh, first time in Japan?
 Uh huh.
 What brings you to Okinawa?
 I came to see a man.
 Oh yeah.
 You have a friend that you are in love?
 Not quite.
 A friend?
 I never met him.
 Never?
 Who is he?
 May I ask?
 Hattori Hanzo.
 You must have big rats if you need Hattori Hanzo steel.
 Huge.
 May I?
 You may.
 Wait.
 Try the second one from the top.
 You like a samurai sword, I like baseball.
 I wanted to show you these.
 However, someone as you, who knows so much, must surely know.
 I no longer make instruments of death.
 What I have here.
 I keep for their aesthetic and sentimental value.
 Yet, proud as I am of my life's work.
 I have retired.
 Then give me one of these.
 These are not for sale.
 I didn't say sell me.
 I said give me.
 Whyshould I give you?
 Because my vermin is a former student of yours.
 And considering the student, I'd say you have a rather large obligation.
 You can sleep here.
 It was one year after the massacre in El Paso, Texas, the Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her Shakespearian-in-magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo.
 When the final sword was sheathed, it was O-ren iseii and her powerful posse, the crazy 88, that proved the victor.
 The pretty lady to O-ren's right, who's dressed like she's a villain on Startrek, is O-ren's lawyer, best friend and second lieutenant, the half-French-half-Japanese, Sofie Fatale.
 Another former praetorship(?
) of Bill's.
 The young girl in the school uniform is O-ren's personal body guard, 17-year-old GoGo Yurari.
 GoGo may be young, but what she lacks in age, she makes up for in madness.
 See what I mean?
 The bold guy in a black suit and a Kato mask, is Johnny Mo.
 The head general of O-ren's personal army, the crazy 88.
 And just in case you're wondering how could a half-breed-Japanese-Chinese-American become the boss of bosses in Tokyo, Japan, I'll tell you.
 The subject of O-ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once, the night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council.
 The man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is Boss Tanaka.
 And what Boss Tanaka thinks is As your leader, I encourage you from time to time and always in a respectful manner, to question my logic.
 If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so.
 But allow me to convince you.
 And I promise you right here and now, no subject will ever be taboo except of course the subject that was just under discussion.
 The price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or my American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fuckin head.
 Just like this fucker here.
 Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time.
 I didn't think so.
 One ticket to Tokyo,please.
 O-ren Ishii!
 Mickey!
 So O-ren, any more subordinates for me to kill?
 Bingo!
 GoGo, I know you feel you must protest your mistress.
 But I beg youwalk away.
 Is that what I think it is?
 You didn't think that'd be that easy, did you?
 You know, for a second there, yeah, I kindof did.
 Silly rabbit, Trix are for kids.
 THIS IS WHAT YOU GET FOR FUNKING AROUND WITH YAKUZAS!
 NOW GO HOME TO YOUR MOTHER Except you Sofie, you stay right where you are Your instrument is quite impressive.
 Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords.
 You may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai.
 Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie I'm so sorry.
 Please, please forgive my betrayal No more of that But still, I ,I But still nothing, except my aching heart over what she's done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie.
 I've kept you live for two reasons.
 First reason is information.
 But I am gonna to ask you questions.
 And every time you don't give me answers, I'm gonna cut something off.
 And I promise you, they will be things you will miss.
 GIVE ME YOUR ARM!
 I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers, what they've been doing and where I can find them.
 If you had to guess why she left you alive what would be your guess?
 Guessing won't be necessary.
 She informed me.
 She said I could keep my wicked life for two reasons.
 As I said before, I've allowed you to keep your wicked life for two reasons.
 And the second reason is, So you can tell him, in person, everything that happened here tonight.
 I want you to witness the extent of my mercy by witnessing your deformed body.
 I want you to tell him, all the information that you just told me.
 I want him to know what I know.
 I want him to know I want him to know.
 And I want them all to know, they'll all soon be as dead as O-ren.
 That woman deserves her revenge.
 And we deserve to die.
 She must suffer to her last breath.
 How did you find me?
 I'm the man.
 One more thing Sofie is she aware her daughter is still alive?
 Do you find me sadistic?
 You know, Kiddo, I'd like to believe you're aware enough, even now, to know that there's nothing sadistic in my actions.
 At this moment this is me at my most masochistic.
 Bill.
.
 it's your ba.
.
 Looked dead, didn't I?
 Well, I wasn't.
 But it wasn't from lack of trying, I can tell you that.
 Actually, Bill's last bullet put me in a coma - a coma I was to lie in for four years.
 When I woke up, I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as
"a roaring rampage of revenge.

" I roared and I rampaged, and I got bloody satisfaction.
 I've killed a hell of a lot of people to get to this point, but I have only one more.
 The last one.
 The one I'm driving to right now.
 The only one left.
 And when I arrive at my destination, I am gonna kill Bill.
 Now, the incident that happened at the Two Pines Wedding Chapel that put this whole gory story into motion has since become legend.

"Massacre at Two Pines.

" That's what the newspapers called it.
 The local TV news called it
"The El Paso, Texas, Wedding Chapel Massacre.

" How it happened, who was there, how many got killed and who killed them changes depending on who's telling the story.
 In actual fact, the massacre didn't happen during a wedding at all.
 It was a wedding rehearsal.
 Now, when we come to the part where I say,
"You may kiss the bride,
" you may kiss the bride, but don't stick your tongue in her mouth.
 This might be funny to your friends, but it would be embarrassing to your parents.
 We'll try to restrain ourselves, Reverend.
 Y'all got a song?
 How 'bout
"Love Me Tender
"?
 I can play that.
 Sure.
 Yeah.

"Love Me Tender
" 'd be great.
 Rufus - he's the man.
 Rufus, who was that that you used to play for?
 Rufus Thomas.
 Rufus Thomas.
 Rufus Thomas.
 I was a Drell.
 I was a Drifter.
 I was a Coaster.
 I was part of the Gang.
 I was a Bar-Kay.
 If they come through Texas, I played with 'em.
 Rufus - he's the man.
 Have I forgotten anything?
 Um.
.
 Oh, yes.
 You forgot, uh, the seating arrangements.
 Thank you, Mother.
 Yes.
 Now, the way we normally do this, we have the bride's side, and then we have the groom's side.
 But since the bride ain't got nobody comin', and the groom's got far too many people comin'.
.
 Well, yeah, they're comin' all the way from Oklahoma.
 Right.
.
 Well, I don't see no problem with.
.
 the groom's side sharing the bride's side.
 Do you, Mother?
 I don't have a problem with that.
 But, uh.
.
 Honey, you know, it would be good if you had somebody come.
 You know, as a sign of good faith?
 Well, I don't have anybody, except for Tommy and my friends.
 You have no family?
 Well, I'm workin' on changing that.
 Mrs.
 Harmony, we're all the family this little angel's ever gonna need.
 I'm not feeling very well, and this bitch is starting to piss me off.
 So while y'all blather on, I'm gonna go outside and get some air.
 OK.
 Um, uh, Reverend, sorry, uh.
.
 She's gonna go out and get some air.
 Yeah.
 Given her delicate condition.
 She just needs a few minutes to get it together.
 She'll be OK.
 Right.
 Hello, Kiddo.
 How did you find me?
 I'm the man.
 What are you doin' here?
 What am I doin'?
 Well, a moment ago I was playing my flute.
 At this moment I'm lookin' at the most beautiful bride these old eyes have ever seen.
 Why are you here?
 Last look.
 Are you gonna be nice?
 I've never been nice my whole life.
 But I'll do my best to be sweet.
 Hmm.
 I always told you, your sweet side is your best side.
 I guess that's why you're the only one who's ever seen it.
 I see you got a bun in the oven.
 Hmm.
 I'm knocked up.
 Jeez, Louise.
 That young man of yours sure doesn't believe in wasting time, does he?
 Have you seen Tommy?
 Big guy in the tux?
 Yes.
 Then I saw him.
 I like his hair.
 You promised you'd be nice.
 No, I said I'd do my best.
 That's hardly a promise.
 But you're right.
 What does your young man do for a living?
 He owns a used-record store here in El Paso.
 Ah.
 Music lover, eh?
 He's fond of music.
 Aren't we all?
 And what are you doing for a J-O-B these days?
 I work in the record store.
 Aso.
 It all suddenly seems so clear.
 Do you like it?
 Yeah.
 I like it a lot, smartass.
 I get to listen to music all day, talk about music all day.
 It's really cool.
 It's gonna be a great environment for my little girl to grow up in.
 As opposed to jetting around the world, killing human beings and being paid vast sums of money?
 Precisely.
 Well, my old friend, to each his own.
 However, all cockblockery aside, I am looking forward to meeting your young man.
 I happen to be, more or less, particular whom my gal marries.
 You want to come to the wedding?
 Only if I can sit on the bride's side.
 You'll find it a bit lonely on my side.
 Your side always was a bit lonely.
 But I wouldn't sit anywhere else.
 You know, I had the loveliest dream about you.
.
 Oh, here's Tommy!
 Call me Arlene.
 You must be Tommy!
 Uh-huh.
 Arlene's told me so much about you.
 Honey, you OK?
 Oh, I'm fine.
 Tommy, I'd like you to meet my father.
 Oh, my God!
 Oh, my God, this is great!
 I'm so glad to meet you, sir.
.
 oh, Dad.
 The name's Bill.
 Well, it's great to meet you.
.
 Bill.
 Arlene told me you couldn't make it.
 Surprise.
 That's my pop for ya.
 Always full of surprises.
 Well, in the surprise department, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
 When did you get in?
 Just now.
 Did you come straight from Australia?
 Of course.
 Daddy, I told Tommy that you were in Perth mining for silver, and no one could reach you.
 Lucky for us all, that's not the case.
 So.
.
 What's this all about?
 I've heard of wedding rehearsals, but I don't believe I've ever heard of a wedding dress rehearsal before.
 We thought,
"Why pay so much money for a dress
" you're only gonna wear once?

" Especially when Arlene looks so goddamn beautiful in it.
 So I think we're gonna try to get all the mileage we can out of it.
 Isn't it supposed to be bad luck for the groom to see the bride in her wedding dress before the ceremony?
 Well.
.
 I guess I just believe in living dangerously.
 I know just what you mean.
 Son.
 Some of us have places to be.
 Sure do.
 Look, we gotta go through this one more time, so why don't you have a s.
.
 Oh, my God.
 What am I thinking?
 You should give her away!
 Tommy, that's not exactly Daddy's cup of tea.
 I think Father would be much more comfortable sitting with the rest of the guests.
 Hmm.
 Really?
 That's asking a lot.
 Oh.
 OK.
 Well, forget it.
 But how about we go out to dinner tonight to celebrate?
 Only on the condition that I pay for everything.
 Deal.
 We got to do this now.
 Can I watch?
 Absolutely.
 Have a seat.
 Which is the bride's side?
 Right over here.
 Mother, here we go!
 Now, son, about them vows.
.
 Bill.
.
 I just want.
.
 You don't owe me a damn thing.
 If he's the man you want, then go stand by him.
 Do I look pretty?
 Oh, yes.
 Thank you.
 What the hell?
 No!
 Bill!
 You tellin' me she cut her way through 88 bodyguards 'fore she got to O-Ren?
 Nah, there wasn't really 88 of 'em.
 They just call themselves
"The Crazy 88.

" How come?
 I don't know.
 I guess they thought it sounded cool.
 Anyhow, they all fell under her Hanzo sword.
 She got a Hanzo sword?
 He made one for her.
 Didn't he swear a blood oath to never make another sword?
 It would appear he has broken it.
 Them Japs sure know how to hold a grudge, don't they?
 Or maybe.
.
 you just tend to bring that out in people.
 I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask it, but you haven't, by any chance, kept up with your.
.
 swordplay?
 I, um.
.
 I pawned that years ago.
 You hocked a Hattori Hanzo sword?
 Yep.
 It was priceless.
 Well, not in El Paso, it ain't.
 In El Paso, I got me $250 for it.
 I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill.
 If she wants to fight with me, all she's gotta do is come down to the club and start some shit, and we'll be in a fight.
 I know we haven't spoken in some time, and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant, but you've got to get over being mad at me and start becoming afraid of because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you.
 And, unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed.
 I don't dodge guilt and I don't jew out of paying my comeuppance.
 Can't we just.
.
 forget the past?
 That woman deserves her revenge.
 And we deserve to die.
 But, then again, so does she.
 So I guess we'll just see.
 Won't we?
 Late again.
 Budd, can't you tell time?
 There ain't nobody in here, man.
 Is that Budd?
 Yeah.
 Tell him to get his fucking ass back here!
 OK.
 Budd, Larry'd like a word with ya.
 Take a hit.
 Be somebody, baby.
 You looking for me?
 I don't know what car wash you worked before you came here that let you stroll in 20 minutes late, but it wasn't owned by me and I own a fuckin' car wash.
 Do you want me to leave?
 No, I don't want you to leave.
 I want you to sit and wait.
 Larry, there ain't nobody out there, so.
.

"There's nobody out there, Larry.

" What's your point?
 That you're not needed here?
 My point is I'm the bouncer, and there ain't nobody out there to bounce.
 You saying that the reason that you're not doing the job that I'm paying you to do is that you don't have a job to do?
 No.
.
 Is that what you're saying?
 What are you trying to convince me of, exactly?
 That you're as useless as an asshole right here?
 Well, guess what, buddy.
 I think you just fucking convinced me.
 Let's go to the calendar.
 It's calendar time.
 Calendar time for Buddy.
 OK.
 You working tomorrow?
 Yeah.
 Mm.
 No, you're n.
.
 You don't even know what fucking day you work.
 Here.
 You're not working tomorrow.
 You're working Wednesday.
 Here you are.
 There you go.
 Workin' Thursday?
 Yeah.
 I don't think so.
 Friday?
 I d.
.
 There's your name.
 If you say so.
 There used to be your name.
 OK?
 Saturday.
 There used to be your name.
 Oh.
 Uh, Monday.
.
 Here, how about that?
 Fuckin' with your cash is the only thing you kids seem to understand.
 OK?
 Now, I want you to go home till I call you.
 Till I call you.
 Before you leave, talk to Rocket.
 She's got a job for you to do.
 And.
.
 the hat.
 That fuckin' hat.
 That fucking hat.
 How many times have I told you, don't wear that fucking hat here?
 How many?
 Customers wear hats.
 Well, I'm not the boss of the customers.
 I'm the boss of you.
 And I'm telling you that I want you to keep that shit-kicker hat at home.
 Yeah, Budd, honey, uh, the toilet is at it again.
 There's shitty water all over the floor.
 OK.
.
 Rocket.
 I'll clean it up.
 Mm-hmm.
 Now, that gentled you down some, didn't it?
 Yep.
 Ain't nobody a badass with a double dose of rock salt dug deep in her tits.
 Not havin'.
.
 tits as fine or as big as yours, I can't even imagine how bad that shit must sting.
 Yet.
.
 I don't want to, neither.
 I win.
 Bill.
 Wrong brother, ya hateful bitch.
 Budd.
 Bingo.
 And to what do I owe this dubious pleasure?
 I just caught me the cowgirl that ain't never been caught.
 Did you kill her?
 Well, not yet, I ain't.
 I shot her full of rock salt.
 She's so gentle right now, I could perform her coup de grâce with a rock.
 Anywho.
.
 Guess what I'm holdin' in my hand right now.
 What?
 A brand-spankin'-new Hattori Hanzo sword.
 And I'm here to tell ya, Elle, that's what I call sharp.
 How much?
 Oh, that's hard to say, bein' that it's.
.
 priceless an' all.
 What's the terms?
 You get your bony ass down here first thing in the morning with a million dollars in folding cash, and I'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man.
 Now, how do you like the sound of that?
 Sounds like we got a deal.
 One condition.
 What?
 She must suffer to her last breath.
 Well.
.
 That, Elle darlin', I can pretty much damn well guarantee.
 Then I'll see you in the mornin', millionaire.
 All right.
 Wakey-wakey.
 Eggs and bakey.
 Agh!
 I'm done!
 Get me outta this hole!
 Good.
 Whew.
 Whoa, look at those eyes.
 This bitch is furious.
 What did I tell ya?
 Is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?
 Or.
.
 is she the cutest little blond pussy you ever saw?
 I seen better.
 You got anything to say?
 White women call this
"the silent treatment.

" And we let 'em think we don't like it.
 You grab the feet, I'll get the head.
 Hey.
 Hey.
 Hey!
 Wiggle worm, you see this?
 You see it, don't ya?
 That's a can of Mace.
 Mm-hmm.
 No.
 You're goin' underneath the ground tonight.
 And.
.
 that's all there is to it.
 I wanna bury ya.
 I was gonna bury ya.
.
 with this.
 But if you're gonna act like a horse's ass, I'm gonna spray this whole goddamn can right in your eyeballs!
 I'll burn 'em right outta your fuckin' head.
 Then you're gonna be blind and burnin' and buried alive.
 Now, what's it gonna be, sister?
 That's a wise decision.
 This is for breakin' my brother's heart.
 Once upon a time in China, some believe around the year one, double aught, three, head priest of the White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down a road contemplating whatever it is that a man of Pai Mei's infinite powers would contemplate - which is another way of saying
"Who knows?

" - when a Shaolin monk appeared on the road, traveling in the opposite direction.
 As the monk and the priest crossed paths, Pai Mei, in a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the slightest of nods.
 The nod was not returned.
 Now, was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei?
 Or did he just fail to see the generous social gesture?
 The motives of the monk remain unknown.
 What is known were the consequences.
 The next morning, Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin temple and demanded of the temple's head abbot that he offer Pai Mei his neck to repay the insult.
 The abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find Pai Mei was inconsolable.
 So began the Massacre of the Shaolin Temple and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus.
 And so began the legend of Pai Mei's Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique.
 And what, pray tell, is the Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique?
 Quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of martial arts.
 He hits you with his fingertips at five different pressure points on your body, and then lets you walk away.
 But once you've taken five steps your heart explodes inside your body and you fall to the floor, dead.
 Did he teach you that?
 No.
 He teaches no one the Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique.
 Now, one of the things I've always liked about you, Kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years.
 So, allow me to impart a word to the wise.
 Whatever.
.
 Whatever Pai Mei says, obey.
 If you flash him, even for an instant, a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out.
 And if you throw any American sass his way, he'll snap your back and your neck like they were twigs.
 And that will be the story of you.
 He'll accept you as his student.
 What happened to you?
 Nothin'.
 Get in a fight?
 Friendly contest.
 Why did he accept me?
 Because he's a very, very, very old man.
 And, like all rotten bastards, when they become old, they get lonely.
 Which has no effect on their dispositions, but it does teach them the value of company.
 Whew.
 Oh.
 Just seein' those steps again makes me ache.
 You're gonna have a lot of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker.
 When will I see you again?
 That's the title of my favorite soul song of the 70s.
 What?
 Nothin'.
 When he tells me you're done.
 When do you think that might be?
 That, my dearest, depends entirely on you.
 Now remember, no sarcasm, no back talk.
 At least not for the first year or so.
 You're gonna have to let him warm up to you.
 He hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women.
 So in your case.
.
 it might take a little while.
 Adiós.
 A little.
 I am proficient in Tiger-Crane Style, and I am more than proficient in the exquisite art of the Samurai sword.
 Argh!
 Argh!
 No, please don't!
 Aaargh!
 Yes!
 Come on, you bitch.
 OK, Pai Mei.
 Here I come.
 May I have a glass of water, please?
 So that's a Texas funeral?
 Yep.
 I have to give it to ya, Budd.
 That's a pretty fucked-up way to die.
 What's the name on the grave she's buried under?
 Paula Schultz.
 Can I look at the sword?
 That's my money right there in that red bag, isn't it?
 It sure is.
 Well, then, it's your sword now.
 What's that you said?
 So this is a Hattori Hanzo sword.
 That's a Hanzo sword, all right.
 Bill tells me you once had one of these of your own.
 Yeah, once.
 Yeah?
 How does this one compare to that?
 If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you compare it to every other sword ever made - wasn't made - by Hattori Hanzo.
 Here you go.
 Wrap your lips around that.
 So, which
"R
" are you filled with?
 What?
 They say the number-one killer of old people is retirement.
 People got a job to do, they tend to live a little bit longer so they can do it.
 I've always figured that warriors and their enemies share the same relationship.
 So now that you're not gonna have to face your enemy no more on the battlefield, which
"R
" ya filled with?
 Relief?
 Or regret?
 A little bit of both.
 Horseshit.
 I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both.
 But I know damn well that you feel one more than you feel the other.
 And the question was, which one is it?
 Regret.
 You know, you gotta hand it to the old girl.
 I never saw anybody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill.
 Bill thought she was so damn smart.
 And I tried to tell him she was just smart for a blonde.
 Thanks a bunch.
 All right.
 Argh!
 Argh!
 Mmm.
 I'm sorry, Budd.
 That was rude of me, wasn't it?
 Budd, I'd like to introduce my friend, the black mamba.
 Black mamba, this is Budd.
 You know, before I picked that little fella up, I looked him up on the Internet.
 Fascinating creature, the black mamba.
 Listen to this.

"In Africa, the saying goes
" 'In the bush, an elephant can kill you, a leopard can kill you, and a black mamba can kill you.
 But only with the mamba, and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time,
"is death sure.
'
"
"Hence its handle, 'Death Incarnate.
'
" Pretty cool, huh?

"Its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons, acting on the nervous system, causing paralysis.

"
"The venom of a black mamba can kill a human being in four hours if, say, bitten on the ankle or the thumb.

"
"However, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within 20 minutes.

" Now, you should listen to this, 'cause this concerns you.

"The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bite can be gargantuan.

" You know, I've always liked that word
"gargantuan.

" I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence.

"If not treated quickly with antivenom, ten to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings.

"
"However, the black mamba can deliver
" as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom
"from a single bite.

" Now, in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left, let me answer that question you asked earlier more thoroughly.
 Right at this moment the biggest
"R
" I feel is regret.
 Regret that maybe the greatest warrior I have ever met met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin', scrub, alky piece of shit like you.
 That woman deserved better.
 Bill.
 I have some tragic news.
 Your brother's dead.
 I am so sorry, baby.
 She put a black mamba in his camper.
 I got her, sweetie.
 She's dead.
 Let me put it this way, you ever start feeling sentimental, go to Barstow, California.
 When you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers.
 Then you take those flowers to Huntington Cemetery on Fuller and Guadalupe, look for the headstone marked
"Paula Schultz,
" and lay them on the grave.
 'Cause you will be standing at the final resting place of Beatrix Kiddo.
 Marty Kitrosser?
 Here.
 Melanie Harrhouse?
 Here.
 Beatrix Kiddo?
 Here.
 Look.
.
 I can be there in about four hours.
 Do you want me to come over?
 No, no, no, no.
 You need me, baby, I'm there.
 OK.
 I'm leaving now.
 You go smoke some pot or somethin'.
 I'll be there soon.
 Ugh.
 Gross.
 Yaagh!
 Agh!
 Hi-ya!

"To my brother, Budd.
 The only man I ever loved.
 Bill.

" What's that?
 Budd's Hanzo sword.
 He said he pawned it.
 Guess that makes him a liar now, don't it?
 Elle?
 Bea.
 Somethin' I've always been curious about.
 Just between us girls, what did you say to Pai Mei to make him snatch out your eye?
 Argh!
 Ow!
 Ow!
 I called him a miserable old fool.
 Ooh.
 Bad idea.
 Know what I did?
 I killed that miserable old fool.
 How do you like the fish head, you miserable old fool?
 I poisoned his fish heads.
 And I told him
"To me, the word of an old fool like you
" is worth less than nothing.

" That's right.
 I killed your master.
 And now I'm gonna kill you, too.
 With your own sword, no less.
 Which, in the very immediate future, will become my sword.
 Bitch.
 You don't have a future.
 Fucking bitch!
 Fucking bitch!
 I'll kill you!
 You're fuckin' dead!
 You bitch!
 You bitch!
 I'll fucking kill you, you bitch!
 Oh, I'll get you!
 I'm gonna.
.
 Where are you?
 Lemme fuckin' at you!
 Where are you?
 I'm coming, you fucking bitch!
 You're fucking dead!
 You're dead!
 Oh.
.
 shit!
 Like most men who never knew their father, Bill collected father figures.
 The first was Esteban Vihaio.
 Esteban was a pimp and a friend of Bill's mother.
 He ran a brothel in Acuna, Mexico, for over 50 years.
 His army, the Acuna Boys, made up of the fatherless offspring of his whores, ran Acuna.
 He ran the Acuna Boys.
 Now, at the age of 80, it would be this retired gentleman of leisure who could point me in Bill's direction.
 Señor Esteban Vihaio?
 Yes.
 May I join you?
 Only on the condition that you call me Esteban.
 May I join you, Esteban?
 Please.
 ¿Americana?
 Yes.
 I speak a little Spanish, if you prefer.
 No, no, no, no.
 I prefer English.
 I haven't spoken it in a while, but I would relish the opportunity to converse with such a pretty companion as yourself.
 It's my pleasure to be in the company of such a fine gentleman as yourself.
 I must warn you, young lady, I am susceptible to flattery.
 How may I be of service to you?
 Where's Bill?
 Ahh.
 You must be Beatrix.
 I can see the attraction.
 I remember when Bill was only five years old, I took him to the movies.
 It was a movie starring Lana Turner.
 The Postman Always Ring Twice, with John Garfield.
 And whenever she would appear on the screen, Bill would begin compulsively to suck his thumb to an obscene amount.
 And I knew from this very moment this boy was a fool for blondes.
 Mmm.
 You know, being a fool for a woman such as yourself is always the right thing to do.
 If we had met when I was back in business, you would have been my number-one lady.
 Well, I'm flattered.
 You goddamn well better be.
 This.
.
 I heard you were driving a truck.
 My Pussy Wagon died on me.
 The Pussy died.
 Hmm.
 Bill shot you in the head, no?
 Yes.
 Hmm.
 I would have been much nicer.
 I would have just cut your face.
 You must forgive me.
 Please.
.
 you have a drink with me.
 Clara!
 Coming.
 Dos añejo.
 Gracias.
 What were we talking about?
 Bill.
 Where's Bill?
 Where's Bill.
 Yeah.
 Hmm.
 Bill is at the Villa Quatro, on the road to Salina.
 I will draw you a map.
 Bill is like a son to me.
 Do you know why I help you?
 No.
 Because he would want me to.
 Now, that I don't believe.
 Ahh.
 How else is he ever going to see you again?
 Freeze, Mommy.
 Bang, bang!
 Oh!
 Oh!
 She got us, B.
B.
 Mommy got us.
 Oh, I'm dying.
 I'm dying.
 Fall down, sweetheart.
 Mommy shot us.
 But little did Quickdraw Kiddo know that little B.
B.
 was only playing possum, due to the fact that she was impervious to bullets.
 I am pervious to bullets, Mommy.
 Hey, get back down there.
 You're playing possum.
 So, as the smirking killer advanced on what she thought was a bullet-ridden corpse, that's when little B.
B.
 fired.
 Bang, bang!
 You're dead, Mommy.
 So die.
 Oh!
 B.
B.
 Oh!
 B.
B.
.
 I should've known.
 You are.
.
 the best.
 Oh, Mommy.
 Don't die.
 I was just playing.
 I know.
 I told her that you were asleep, but that one day you'd wake up and come back to her.
 And she asked me,
"If Mommy's been asleep since I was born
", then how will she know what I look like?

" To which I replied,
"Because Mommy's been dreaming of you.

" That's what I said.
 Did you dream of me?
 I dreamed of you.
 Every single night, baby.
 Every single night.
 I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy.
 Now, let me look at you.
 Oh.
 My, my, my, what a pretty little girl you are.
 You're pretty too, Mommy.
 Tell Mommy what you said when I showed you her picture.
 Mm-mm.
 Come on, shy girl.
 Mm-mm.
 Come on.
 You know what you said.
 Come on.
 Tell Mommy.
 It'll make her feel good.
 Come on.
 Mm-mm.
 Yeah.
 Come on.
 I said.
.
 I said
"You're the most beautifulest woman I ever saw in the whole wide world.

" That's the truth.
 That's what she said.
 B.
B.
, don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world?
 Yes, I do.
 Matter of fact, it's better than pretty.
 What's better than pretty?
 Mmm.
.
 Gorgeous.
 Very good.
 Gorgeous.
 Mommy is gorgeous.
 Hmm.
 You know, sweetie, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy.
 Why, Daddy?
 Were you being a bad daddy?
 I'm afraid I was.
 I was a real bad daddy.
 Our little girl learned about life and death the other day.
 Wanna tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio?
 I killed him.
 Emilio was her goldfish.
 Emilio was my goldfiss.
 She came running into my room, holding the fish in her hand and crying,
"Daddy!
 Daddy!
 Emilio's dead.

" And I said,
"Really?
 That's so sad.

"
"How did he die?

" And what did you say?
 I stepped on him.
 Actually, young lady, the words you so strategically used were
"I accidentally stepped on him.

" To which I queried,
"And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?

" And she said,
"No, no, no.

" Emilio was on the carpet when I stepped on him.

" Mmm.
 The plot thickens.

"And just how did Emilio get on the carpet?

" And, Mommy, you would've been so proud of her.
 She didn't lie.
 She said she took Emilio out of his bowl and put him on the carpet.
 And what was Emilio doing on the carpet?
 Flapping.
 And then you stomped on him.
 Uh-huh.
 And when you lifted up your foot, what was Emilio doing then?
 Nothing.
 He stopped flapping, didn't he?
 She told me later that the second she lifted up her foot and saw Emilio not flapping, she knew what she had done.
 Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death?
 A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet.
 So powerful, even a four-year-old with no concept of life or death knew what it meant.
 You loved Emilio, didn't you?
 Uh-huh.
 Well, I love Mommy, too.
 But I did to Mommy what you did to Emilio.
 You stomped on Mommy?
 Worse.
 I shot Mommy.
 Not pretend shooting like we were just doing.
 I shot her for real.
 Why?
 Did you want to see what would happen?
 No, I knew what would happen to Mommy if I shot her.
 What I didn't know was, when I shot Mommy, what would happen to me.
 What happened?
 I was very sad.
 And that's when I learned some things, once you do, they can never be undone.
 What happened to Mommy?
 Why don't you ask Mommy?
 You OK, Mommy?
 Did it hurt?
 No, sweetie.
 Doesn't hurt anymore.
 Did it make you sick?
 No.
 It made me sleep.
 That's why I haven't been with you, B.
B.
 I've been asleep.
 But you're awake now, Mommy.
 Right?
 I'm wide awake, pretty girl.
 B.
B.
, would you like Mommy to watch a video with you before sleepy time?
 Uh-huh.
 Mommy, do you wanna watch a video with me before sleepy time?
 Oh, yeah!
 I would love to.
 Which one do you wanna watch?
 Shogun Assassin.
 No, B.
B.
 Shogun Assassin is too long.
 Mm-mm.
 No, it's not.
 Well, then, I'll leave you ladies to it.
 When I was little, my father was famous.
 He was the greatest samurai in the empire.
 And he was the shogun's decapitator.
 He cut off the heads of 131 lords.
 My father would come home to Mother, and when he would see her he would forget about the killings.
 He wasn't scared of the shogun, but the shogun was scared of him.
 Maybe that was the problem.
 One night, the shogun sent.
.
 I was just admiring your sword.
 Quite a piece of work.
 Speaking of which, how is Hanzo-san?
 He's good.
 Has his sushi gotten any better?
 You know, I couldn't believe it.
 You got him to make you a sword.
 It was easy.
 I just dropped your name, Bill.
 That'd do it.
 I suppose the idea is we cross Hanzo swords.
 Am I right?
 Well, it just so happens this hacienda has its own private beach.
 And that private beach just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight.
 And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight.
 So, sword fighter, if you want a sword fight, that's where I suggest.
 But if you wanna be old school about it - and you know I'm all about old school - then we could wait until dawn and slice each other up at sunrise like a couple of real-life, honest.
.
 Now, if you don't settle down, I'm gonna have to put one in your kneecap.
 And I hear tell that's a very painful place to get shot in.
 I'm just fuckin' with you.
 Now, when it comes to you and us I have a few unanswered questions.
 So, before this tale of bloody revenge reaches its climax, I'm gonna ask you some questions, and I want you to tell me the truth.
 However, therein lies a dilemma.
 Because when it comes to the subject of me, I believe you are truly and utterly incapable of telling the truth.
 Especially to me.
 And least of all, to yourself.
 And when it comes to the subject of me, I am truly and utterly incapable of believing anything you say.
 How do you suppose we solve this dilemma?
 Well, it just so happens, I have a solution.
 Agh!
 Gotcha!
 God damn!
 What the fuck did you just shoot me with?
 My greatest invention.
 Or at least my favorite.
 Don't touch it, or I'll stick another one right in your cheek.
 What lies within that dart, just begging to course its way through your veins is an incredibly potent and quite infallible truth serum.
 I call it
"The Undisputed Truth.

" Twice as strong as sodium pentothal, with no druggie aftereffects.
 Except for a slight wave of euphoria.
 You feel it?
 Euphoria?
 Yeah.
 No.
 Too bad.
 As you know, I'm quite keen on comic books.
 Especially the ones about superheroes.
 I find the whole mythology surrounding superheroes fascinating.
 Take my favorite superhero, Superman.
 Not a great comic book.
 Not particularly well drawn.
 Mmm.
 But the mythology.
.
 The mythology is not only great, it's unique.
 How long does this shit take to go into effect?
 About two minutes.
 Just long enough for me to finish my point.
 Now, a staple of the superhero mythology is, there's the superhero and there's the alter ego.
 Batman is actually Bruce Wayne, Spider-Man is actually Peter Parker.
 When that character wakes up in the morning, he's Peter Parker.
 He has to put on a costume to become Spider-Man.
 And it is in that characteristic Superman stands alone.
 Superman didn't become Superman.
 Superman was born Superman.
 When Superman wakes up in the morning, he's Superman.
 His alter ego is Clark Kent.
 His outfit with the big red
"S,
" that's the blanket he was wrapped in as a baby when the Kents found him.
 Those are his clothes.
 What Kent wears - the glasses, the business suit - that's the costume.
 That's the costume Superman wears to blend in with us.
 Clark Kent is how Superman views us.
 And what are the characteristics of Clark Kent?
 He's weak, he's unsure of himself, he's a coward.
 Clark Kent is Superman's critique on the whole human race.
 Sorta like Beatrix Kiddo and Mrs.
 Tommy Plympton.
 Aso.
 The point emerges.
 You would've worn the costume of Arlene Plympton.
 But you were born Beatrix Kiddo.
 And every morning when you woke up, you'd still be Beatrix Kiddo.
 Oh, you can take the needle out.
 Are you calling me a superhero?
 I'm calling you a killer.
 A natural-born killer.
 You always have been, and you always will be.
 Moving to El Paso, working in a used-record store, goin' to the movies with Tommy, clipping coupons.
 That's you trying to disguise yourself as a worker bee.
 That's you tryin' to blend in with the hive.
 But you're not a worker bee.
 You're a renegade killer bee.
 And no matter how much beer you drank or barbecue you ate or how fat your ass got, nothing in the world would ever change that.
 First question: did you really think your life in El Paso was gonna work?
 No!
 But I would've had B.
B.
!
 Don't get me wrong.
 I think you would have been a wonderful mother.
 But you are a killer.
 All those people you killed to get to me felt damn good, didn't they?
 Yes.
 Every single one of them?
 Yes.
 That was the warmup round.
 Now comes the $64,000 question.
 Why did you run away from me with my baby?
 Do you remember the last assignment you sent me on?
 Of course.
 Lisa Wong.
 The morning I left, I was sick.
 On the plane, I threw up.
 So I started thinking maybe I was pregnant.

"Easy to use.
 Remove cap and urinate on the absorbent end for five seconds.

"
"Accurate results in only 90 seconds.

"
"You can read the results as soon as the line appears in the window.

" Fuck.
 What I didn't know was that somewhere on my journey I had been spotted.
 With me in L.
A.
, it didn't take Lisa Wong long to send an assassin of her own.
 Hello, can I help you?
 Hello, I'm Karen Kim.
 I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel.
 I have a welcome gift from the management.
 Oh, that's nice.
 Um.
.
 Can you just leave it by the door?
 You pretty good with that shotgun?
 Not that I have to be at this range, but I'm a fuckin' surgeon with this shotgun.
 Well, guess what, bitch.
 I'm better than Annie Oakley, and I got you right in my sight.
 I could blow your fuckin' head off.
 Not before I put one right between your eyes, so let's talk.
 Karen.
.
 I just found out right now not a moment before you blew a hole through the door that I'm pregnant.
 What is this?
 On the floor by the door is a strip that says I'm pregnant.
 Bullshit.
 Any other time you'd be 100 percent right.
 This time you're 100 percent wrong.
 I'm the deadliest woman in the world.
 But right now I'm just scared shitless for my baby.
 Please.
 Just look at the strip.
 Please!
 Stay where you are and don't move.
 I don't know what this fuckin' shit means.
 The box with the directions - it's right there.

"Easy to use.

"
"Remove the cap and urinate on the absorbent end.

" Blue means pregnant.
 I'll read it myself, thank you.
 Oh, OK.
 Say I were to believe you.
 What then?
 Just go home.
 I'll do the same.
 Congratulations.
 Before that strip turned blue I was a woman.
 I was your woman.
 I was a killer who killed for you.
 Before that strip turned blue, I would've jumped a motorcycle onto a speeding train.
 For you.
 But once that strip turned blue I could no longer do any of those things.
 Not anymore.
 Because I was gonna be a mother.
 Can you understand that?
 Yes.
 But why didn't you tell me then, instead of now?
 Once you knew, you'd claim her.
 And I didn't want that.
 Not your decision to make.
 Yes.
 But it's the right decision, and I made it for my daughter.
 She deserved to be born with a clean slate.
 But with you she would've been born into a world she shouldn't have.
 I had to choose.
 I chose her.
 You know, five years ago, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen, you performing a coup de grâce on me by bustin' a cap in my crown would've been right at the top of the list.
 I'd have been wrong, wouldn't I?
 I'm sorry.
 Was that a question?
 Of impossible things that could never happen, yes, in this instance, you would've been wrong.
 Well?
 When you never came back, I naturally assumed Lisa Wong, or somebody else, had killed you.
 Oh!
 And for the record, letting somebody think somebody they love is dead when they're not is quite cruel.
 I mourned you for three months.
 And in the third month of mourning you I tracked you down.
 I wasn't tryin' to track you down.
 I was tryin' to track down the fucking assholes I thought killed you.
 So I find you.
 And what do I find?
 Not only are you not dead, you're getting married to some fucking jerk.
 And you're pregnant.
 I.
.
 overreacted.
 You overreacted?
 Is that your explanation?
 I didn't say I was gonna explain myself.
 I said I was gonna tell you the truth.
 But if that's too cryptic, let's get literal.
 I'm a killer.
 I'm a murdering bastard.
 You know that.
 And there are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard.
 You experienced some of them.
 Was my reaction really that surprising?
 Yes.
 It was.
 Could you do what you did?
 Of course you could.
 But I never thought you would, or could, do that to me.
 I'm really sorry, Kiddo, but you thought wrong.
 You and I have unfinished business.
 Baby.
.
 you ain't kiddin'.
 Pai Mei taught you the Five-Point-Palm Exploding-Heart Technique?
 'Course he did.
 Why didn't you tell me?
 I don't know.
 Because I'm a bad person.
 No.
 You're not a bad person.
 You're a terrific person.
 You're my favorite person.
 But every once in a while you can be a real cunt.
 How do I look?
 You look ready.
 Well, well, well.
 If it ain't the little flower.
 Good evening, Mr.
 and Mrs.
 America and all the ships at sea.
 Let's go to press.
 Flash.
 Do you have a magpie in your home?
 If you do, you are most fortunate.
 The magpie is the most charming bird in all the world.
 He is the best friend a farmer ever had.
 Treat him gently.
 Treat him kindly.
 And always remember, the magpie deserves your respect.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Thank you.
 Oh, thank you.
 Now, I'll tell you what I'm gonna do.
 I ain't got no headache.
 Oh, yes, you have, brother.
 Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin
" is about.
 It's all about a girl who digs a guy with a big dick.
 The entire song is a metaphor for big dicks.
 No, it ain't.
 It's about a girl who's very vulnerable.
 She's been fucked over a few times and she meets a guy who's sensitive.
 Whoa.
 Timeout.
 Tell that bullshit to the tourists.
 Toby?
 Who the fuck is Toby?

"Like A Virgin
" is not about some sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.
 That's what
"True Blue
" is about.
 No argument about that.
 - Which one is
"True Blue
"?
 - It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.
 I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops shit, and I've heard of
"True Blue.

" I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
 All I asked is, how's it go?
 Excuse me for not being the world's biggest Madonna fan.
 Personally, I can do without her.
 I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline
" but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach
" phase, I tuned out.
 Hey, you guys are making me lose my train of thought here.
 I was sayin' something.
 What was it?
 Oh, Toby's that little Chinese girl.
 - What was her last name?
 - What's that?
 It's an old address book I found in a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.
 - What was that name?
 - What the fuck was I talkin' about?
 You said
"True Blue
" was about a guy-- a sensitive girl who meets a nice guy but
"Like A Virgin
" was a metaphor for big dicks.
 Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin
" is about.
 It's all about this cooze who's a regular fuck machine.
 I'm talkin' morning, day, night, afternoon dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick, dick!
 - How many
"dicks
" is that?
 - A lot.
 Then one day, she meets this John Holmes motherfucker.
 It's like,
"Whoa, baby.

" He's like Charles Bronson in
"The Great Escape.

" He's diggin' tunnels.
 Now she's gettin' serious dick action.
 She's feelin' somethin' she ain't felt since forever: pain, pain.
 Chew?
 Toby Chew?
 It hurts.
 It hurts her.
 It shouldn't hurt her.
 Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.
 But when this cat fucks her, it hurts.
 It hurts just like it did the first time.
 You see, the pain is reminding a fuck machine what it was once like to be a virgin.
 Hence,
"Like A Virgin.

" Wong.
 -Give me that fuckin' thing.
 -What in hell do you think you're doin'?
 I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
 I'll give it back to you when we leave.
 What do you mean, when we leave?
 Give me it back now!
 For the past 15 minutes now, you've been droning on about names.

"Toby.
 Toby?
 Toby?
 Toby Wong.
 Toby Wong?
 Toby Wong.
 Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan.

" I've got Madonna's big dick comin' out of my left ear and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what-- comin' out of my right.
 Give me that book.
 Are you gonna put it away?
 I'm gonna do whatever the fuck I want with it.
 Well, then I'm afraid I'm gonna have to keep it.
 Hey, Joe, want me to shoot this guy?
 Shit.
 You shoot me in a dream, you better wake up and apologize.
 You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s
" weekend?
 Yeah.
 That's fuckin' great.
 - You believe the songs they're playin'?
 - Know what I heard the other day?

"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat
" by little Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.
 I haven't heard that song since I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.
 When I was comin' down here,
"The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia
" came on.
 I ain't heard that song since it was big.
 But when it was big, I must've heard it a million-trillion fuckin' times.
 But this is the first time I ever realized that the girl singin' the song is the one who shot Andy.
 You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence was the one who shot Andy?
 - I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
 - They say that at the end of the song.
 I know, motherfucker.
 I just heard it.
 That's what I'm talkin' about.
 I must've zoned out during that part before.
 All right, I'll take care of the check.
 All right, I'll take care of the check.
 You guys can get the tip.
 Should be about a buck apiece.
 And you, when I come back I want my book.
 Sorry.
 It's my book now.
 Hey, I changed my mind.
 Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?
 All right, everybody cough up some green for the little lady.
 Come on, throw in a buck.
 I don't tip.
 - You don't tip?
 - I don't believe in it.
 You don't believe in tipping?
 Do you know what these chicks make?
 They make shit.
 If she don't make enough money, she can quit.
 I don't even know a fuckin' Jew who'd have the balls to say that.
 Let me get this straight.
 You don't ever tip, huh?
 I don't tip because society says I have to.
 If they really put forth the effort, I'll give 'em somethin' extra.
 But this tipping automatically, it's for the birds.
 As far as I'm concerned, they're just doin' their job.
 - This girl was nice.
 - She was okay.
 - She wasn't anything special.
 - What's special?
 Take you in the back and suck your dick?
 I'd go over 12% for that.
 I ordered coffee, all right?
 She's only filled my cup three times.
 I want it filled six times.
 Six times?
 Well, what if she's too fuckin' busy?
 The words
"too fuckin' busy
" shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.
 Excuse me, Mr.
 Pink, but the last fuckin' thing you need's another cup of coffee.
 These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
 They make minimum wage.
 I used to work minimum wage, and when I did I wasn't lucky enough to have a job that society deemed tip-worthy.
 You don't care they're countin' on your tips to live?
 You know what this is?
 The world's smallest violin, playin' just for the waitresses.
 You don't have any idea what you're talkin' about.
 These people bust their ass.
 This is a hard job.
 So's working at McDonald's, but you don't feel the need to tip them.
 They're servin' you food, but society says
"Don't tip these guys over here, but tip these guys.

" That's bullshit.
 Waitressing is the number-one occupation for female non-college graduates in this country.
 It's the one job basically any woman can get and make a living on.
 The reason is because of their tips.
 Fuck all that.
 I'm very sorry the government taxes their tips.
 That's fucked up.
 That ain't my fault.
 It would appear that waitresses are one of the many groups the government fucks in the ass on a regular basis.
 Show me a paper that says the government shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.
 I'll vote for it.
 But what I won't do is play ball.
 This non-college bullshit, I got two words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.
 If you're expectin' me to help out with the rent, you're in for a big surprise.
 He's convinced me.
 Give me my dollar back.
 Hey.
 Leave the dollars there.
 All right, ramblers, let's get ramblin'.
 Wait a minute.
 Who didn't throw in?
 - Mr.
 Pink.
 - Mr.
 Pink?
 - Why not?
 - He don't tip.
 He don't tip?
 - You don't tip?
 - He don't believe in it.
 Shut up.
 What do you mean, you don't believe in it?
 Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
 I paid for your goddamn breakfast.
 Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
 But normally I would never do this.
 Never mind what you normally would do.
 Just cough in your goddamn buck like everybody else.
 Thank you.
 That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?

" followed by Edison Lighthouse's
"Love Grows Where My Rosemary Goes
" as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s
" weekend just keeps on truckin'.
 just keeps on truckin'.
 I'm gonna die.
 I'm gonna die!
 Just hold on, buddy boy!
 I'm gonna die!
 - I'm sorry!
 - Give me your hand.
 I can't believe she killed me, man!
 Who'd have fuckin' thought that?
 Hey, just cancel that shit right now!
 You're hurt.
 You're hurt real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!
 All this blood's scarin' the shit out of me, Larry!
 I'm gonna die!
 I know it!
 Excuse me, I didn't realize you had a degree in medicine.
 Are you a doctor?
 Are you a doctor?
 Answer me, please!
 Are you a doctor?
 No, I'm not.
 I'm not.
 So you admit you don't know what you're talkin' about.
 If you're through givin' me your amateur opinion, lie back and listen.
 I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous, Joe's gonna get you a doctor the doctor's gonna fix you up and you're gonna be okay.
 Now say it!
 You're gonna be okay!
 Say it!
 You're gonna be okay!
 Say the goddamn words!
 You're gonna be okay!
 Oh, God!
 Say the goddamn fuckin' words!
 Say it!
 Okay, Larry.
 Correct!
 Correct!
 I'm okay.
 Look where we are.
 Look where we are.
 She had a baby, man.
 She had a baby!
 We're in a warehouse.
 Who's a tough guy?
 Who's a tough guy?
 Come on, who's a tough guy?
 Who's a tough guy?
 You're a tough guy.
 You're a fuckin' tough guy.
 We're in a warehouse.
 Look where we are.
 We made it.
 We made it.
 We fuckin' made it.
 We have fuckin' made it.
 We're in a warehouse.
 Look where we are.
 Look where we are.
 Hold on.
 Hold on.
 - Shit!
 - Stop bangin' your head.
 You're gonna bang a fuckin' hole in the floor.
 You don't wanna hurt the fuckin' floor, do you?
 I can't do anything for you.
 But when Joe gets here which should be any time now he's gonna help you out, he's gonna take care of you.
 We're gonna sit and wait for Joe.
 - Who are we waitin' for?
 - Joe.
 Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.
 Would you please hold me?
 Yeah, sure.
 You go ahead and be scared.
 You've been brave enough for one day.
 I just want you to relax now, okay?
 You're not gonna fuckin' die.
 You're gonna be fine.
 When Joe gets here, he'll make you 100% again.
 Am I hurt?
 I'm hurt bad, Larry.
 It's not good, no.
 Hey, Larry bless your heart for what you're tryin' to do.
 I was panicking for a minute back there.
 But I got my senses back now.
 The situation is, I'm shot in the belly.
 Without medical attention, I'm gonna die.
 - I can't take you to a hospital.
 - Fuck jail, man!
 You don't have to take me in.
 Just drive me up to the front, man.
 Just drop me on the sidewalk.
 I'll take care of myself.
 I won't tell 'em anything, man.
 I won't tell 'em anything.
 I swear to fucking God, man.
 Just look in my eyes, Larry.
 Look in my eyes.
 I won't tell them anything.
 You'll be safe, man.
 You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
 All right?
 Listen to me.
 You're gonna be fine.
 Along with the kneecap the gut is the most painful area a guy can get shot in.
 No shit!
 But it takes a long time to die from it.
 I'm talkin' days.
 You're gonna wish you were dead, but it takes days to die from your wound.
 Time is on your side.
 Was that a fucking setup, or what?
 Shit.
 Orange got tagged?
 Gut shot.
 Fuck.
 Where's Brown?
 Dead.
 How did he die?
 How the fuck do you think?
 The cops shot him.
 This is bad.
 This is so fucking bad.
 Is it bad?
 As opposed to good?
 Man, this is fucked up.
 This is so fucked up.
 Somebody fucked us up big time, man.
 - You really think we were set up?
 - Do you even doubt it, man?
 I don't think we got set up, I know it.
 Where did all those cops come from, huh?
 One minute they're not there, and the next minute they're there.
 I didn't hear any sirens.
 The alarm went off, okay?
 When an alarm goes, you got a four-minute response time.
 Unless a patrol car is cruising that street at that moment you got four minutes before they can realistically respond.
 In one minute, there were 17 blue boys out there all knowing exactly what the fuck they were doing, and they were all there!
 Remember that second wave that showed up in the cars?
 Those were the ones responding to the alarm, but those first motherfuckers they were there and they were waitin' for us.
 Haven't you fuckin' thought about this?
 I haven't had a chance to think.
 First I was just tryin' to get the fuck outta there.
 And after we got away, I've just been dealin' with him.
 Better start thinkin' about it, 'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.
 I wasn't even gonna come here.
 I was just gonna drive off, man because whoever set us up knows about this place.
 There could've been cops here waitin'!
 There could be cops comin' right now!
 Let's go in the other room.
 Hey.
 In there.
 Larry, don't leave me.
 I'll be right in the other room, okay?
 I'll be right there lookin' at ya.
 I'm right here lookin' at you, okay?
 I'm right over there.
 Larry I'm gonna fucking die.
 Larry.
 What the fuck am I doin' here, man?
 I felt funny about this job right off.
 As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you,
" but I never listen.
 Every time I ever got fucked buying weed, the same thing.
 I didn't trust the guy, but I wanted to believe him.
 If he's not lying and it really is Thai stick, then it's great.
 But it never is, and I always said that if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.
 And I didn't.
 I didn't because of the fuckin' money!
 What's done is done.
 I need you cool.
 Are you cool?
 I'm cool.
 Splash some water on your face.
 Take a breather.
 Relax.
 Have a cigarette.
 I quit.
 - All right.
 - Why, you got one?
 Okay, let's go through what happened.
 We're in the place, everything's going fine.
 Then the alarm gets tripped.
 I turn around and all these cops are outside.
 You're right.
 It was like, bam, I blinked my eyes and they're there.
 Everybody starts going ape-shit.
 Then Mr.
 Blonde starts to shoot all-- - That's not correct.
 - What's wrong with it?
 Okay.
 The cops did not show up after the alarm went off.
 The cops didn't show up until after Mr.
 Blonde started shootin' everybody.
 - Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
 - It wasn't that soon.
 They didn't let their presence be known until after Mr.
 Blonde became a madman.
 I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
 I'm sayin' they were there.
 But they didn't make a move until after Mr.
 Blonde started shootin' everybody.
 I mean, that's how I know we were set up.
 - Mr.
 White, you can see that-- - Enough of this
"Mr.
 White
" shit.
 Wait!
 Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
 I don't wanna know it!
 Jesus Christ, I ain't gonna tell you mine.
 You're right.
 This is bad.
 - How did you get out?
 - I shot my way out.
 Everybody started shootin', so I blasted my way out of there.
 Move it!
 Get outta the way!
 Get the fuck outta the way!
 Get the fuck outta the way!
 Move it!
 Get outta the way!
 Jesus Christ!
 What the fuck is your problem, man?
 - You fuckin' asshole!
 - Fuck you!
 Move!
 Jesus!
 Get outta the car!
 Get the fuck outta the car!
 Move it!
 Move outta the way!
 I tagged a couple of cops.
 Did you kill anybody?
 - A few cops.
 - No real people?
 Just cops.
 Could you believe Mr.
 Blonde?
 That was the most insane fuckin' thing I have ever seen.
 Why the fuck would Joe hire a guy like that?
 I don't want to kill anybody.
 If I gotta get out that door and you're standin' in my way one way or the other you're gettin' outta my way.
 That's the way I look at it.
 The choice between doin' ten years and takin' out some stupid motherfucker ain't no choice at all.
 But I ain't no madman, either.
 What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
 You can't work with a guy like that.
 We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't tag us when he shot the place up.
 I came this close to takin' his ass out myself.
 I mean, everybody panics.
 Everybody.
 Things get tense.
 It's human nature.
 You panic.
 I don't care what your name is, you can't help it.
 Fuck, man, you panic on the inside, in your head, you know?
 You give yourself a couple of seconds, get ahold of it and deal with it.
 What you don't do is start shootin' up the place and start killin' people.
 What you're supposed to do is act like a fuckin' professional.
 A psychopath ain't a professional.
 You can't work with a psychopath.
 You don't know what those sick assholes are gonna do next.
 I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you think that black girl was?
 Twenty?
 - Maybe 21?
 - If that.
 Did you see what happened to anybody else?
 Me and Orange jumped in the car, Brown floored it.
 After that, I don't know what went down.
 It was every man for himself.
 As far as Mr.
 Blonde and Mr.
 Blue are concerned, I ain't got the foggiest 'cause once I got out, I never looked back.
 What do you think?
 What do I think?
 The cops either caught 'em or killed 'em.
 No chance they punched through?
 You found a hole.
 Yeah, and that was a fuckin' miracle.
 But even if they did get away, then where the fuck are they?
 You don't think it's possible one of 'em got ahold of the diamonds and-- - No, no way.
 - How can you be so sure?
 I got the diamonds.
 That's my boy.
 - Where?
 - I stashed 'em.
 If you wanna come with me, let's go get 'em right now, this second.
 'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we should have our fuckin' heads examined.
 That was the plan.
 We meet here.
 Then where the fuck is everybody?
 I say the plan becomes null and void once we found out we got a rat here.
 We ain't got the slightest idea what happened to Mr.
 Blonde or Mr.
 Blue.
 They could both be dead or maybe they're arrested.
 The cops could have 'em right now at the station, sweatin' 'em down.
 They don't know our names, but they could be singin' about this place.
 I swear to God, I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.
 What?
 Two jobs back, it was a four-man job.
 We discovered one of the team was an undercover cop.
 No shit?
 Thank God we discovered in time.
 We had to forget the whole thing, just walk the fuck away from it.
 So who's the rat this time?
 Mr.
 Blue?
 Mr.
 Brown?
 Joe?
 Joe set this whole thing up.
 Maybe he set it up to set it up.
 I don't buy it.
 Me and Joe go back a long time.
 I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't know a thing about this bullshit.
 I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.
 I can say I definitely didn't do it, 'cause I know what I did or didn't do.
 But I cannot definitely say that about anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.
 For all I know, you're the rat.
 For all I know, you're the fuckin' rat!
 All right, now you're usin' your fuckin' head.
 For all we know, he's the rat.
 That kid in there is dying from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take so don't you be calling him a rat!
 Look, I'm right, okay?
 Somebody's a fuckin' rat.
 Where's the commode in this dungeon?
 I gotta take a squirt.
 Go down the hall, make a left, go up the stairs and make a right.
 - By the way, how's Alabama?
 - Alabama?
 I haven't seen Bama in over a year and a half.
 But I thought you two were a team.
 We were for a little while.
 Did about four jobs together, then decided to call it quits.
 Why?
 You push that woman-man thing too long and it gets to you after a while.
 What's she doin' now?
 She hooked up with Frank McGar.
 They've done a couple jobs together.
 Hell of a woman.
 Good little thief.
 - So explain the telegram.
 - Five-man job.
 Bustin' in and bustin' out of a diamond wholesaler's.
 Can you move the ice afterwards?
 I don't know nobody that can move ice.
 No problem.
 We got guys waitin' for it.
 What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
 Didn't he always move your ice?
 He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.
 Twenty years?
 Holy God.
 What for?
 Bad luck.
 I guess you can say that again.
 What's the exposure like?
 Two minutes, tops.
 But it's a tough two minutes.
 Daylight, during business hours, dealing with a crowd.
 But you'll have the guys to deal with the crowd.
 - How many employees?
 - I'd say around 20.
 Security pretty lax.
 They most usually just deal in boxes.
 You know, uncut stones from the diamond syndicate.
 But on this day, they're getting a shipment of polished stones from lsrael.
 They're like a way station, you know?
 -They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
 -No, they're not.
 What's the cut, poppa?
 Juicy, junior.
 Real juicy.
 Look, man, you do what you want.
 I'm outta here, man.
 I'm gonna check into a motel for a few days.
 You know, I'll lay low and I'll call Joe-- Shit.
 Did he fuckin' die on us?
 Huh?
 ls he dead or what?
 - He ain't dead.
 - What is it?
 I think he's just passed out.
 He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
 I thought he was dead for sure.
 Without medical attention, he will die for sure.
 What are we gonna do, man?
 We can't take him to the hospital.
 Without medical attention, he might not live through the night.
 The bullet in his belly is my fault.
 While that might not mean jack shit to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.
 First things first, okay?
 Stayin' here's goofy.
 We gotta book up.
 So what do you suggest we do?
 Go to a hotel?
 We got a guy who's shot in the belly, who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.
 And when he's awake, he screams in pain.
 You got an idea, spit it out.
 Joe could help.
 If we could get in touch with Joe, Joe could get him to a doctor.
 Joe could get a doctor to come to see him.
 Assuming we can trust Joe, how we gonna get in touch with him?
 He's supposed to be here, but he ain't, which makes me nervous about bein' here.
 Even if he is on the up and up, I don't think he's gonna be too happy with us.
 He planned a robbery and he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.
 He's got dead cops, dead robbers, dead civilians.
 I tend to doubt he's gonna have a lot of sympathy for our plight.
 If I was him, I'd put as much distance between me and this mess as possible.
 Before you got here, Mr.
 Orange was askin' me to take him to a doctor, to a hospital.
 I don't like the idea of turnin' him over to the cops but if we don't, he's gonna die.
 He begged me to do it.
 Well, all right.
 Then I guess we take him to a hospital.
 If that's what he said, let's do it.
 Since he don't know nothin' about us, I say it's his decision.
 He knows a little about me.
 What?
 Wait, wait.
 You didn't tell him your name, did you?
 I told him my first name and where I was from.
 Why?
 I told him where I was from a few days ago.
 It was just a natural conversation.
 What was tellin' him your name when you weren't supposed to?
 He asked.
 We had just gotten away from the cops.
 He just got shot.
 It was my fault he got shot.
 He's a fuckin' bloody mess.
 He's screamin'.
 I swear to God, I thought he was gonna die right then and there.
 I'm tryin' to comfort him, telling him not to worry everything's going to be okay, I'm gonna take care of him.
 And he asked me what my name was.
 I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
 What the fuck was I supposed to do?
 Tell him I'm sorry?
 I can't give out that fuckin' information?
 It's against the rules?
 I don't trust you enough?
 Maybe I should've, but I couldn't.
 Fuck you!
 Fuck Joe!
 - I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
 - Don't fuckin' patronize me!
 I have one question.
 Do they have a sheet on you where you're from?
 - Yeah!
 - That's that, then.
 I mean, I was worried about mug shot possibility as it was.
 He knows A, your name, B, your face, C, your hometown and D, your specialty.
 They're not gonna have to show him a lot of pictures for him to pick you out!
 You didn't tell him anything else so they could narrow down the selection?
 If I have to tell you again to back off, we're gonna go 'round and 'round.
 We ain't takin' him to a hospital.
 If we don't, he's gonna die.
 And I'm very sad about that, but some fellas are lucky and some ain't.
 What the fuck are you touchin' me for, man?
 I'll show you who you're fuckin' with!
 You wanna shoot me, you piece of shit?
 I didn't create this situation, I'm dealin' with it!
 You're actin' like a first-year thief!
 I'm actin' like a professional!
 If they get him, they could get you, they could get closer to me and that can't happen!
 You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
 I didn't tell him my name!
 I didn't tell him where I was from!
 Shit!
 Fifteen minutes ago you almost told me your name!
 You're gonna get stuck in a situation you created!
 So if you wanna throw bad looks around, throw 'em at a mirror!
 You kids shouldn't play so rough.
 Somebody's gonna start cryin'.
 Mr.
 Blonde.
 Shit.
 You're fuckin' kickin' me.
 What happened to you?
 Figured you were dead.
 Hey, you okay?
 Did you see what happened to Blue?
 We didn't know what happened to you.
 That's what we were wonderin' about.
 Look, Brown is dead, Orange got it in the belly.
 Enough!
 Enough!
 You better start talkin', asshole.
 'Cause we got shit we need to talk about.
 We're already freaked out.
 We need you actin' freaky like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.
 Okay, let's talk.
 We think we got a rat in the house.
 I guarantee we got a rat in the house.
 What makes you say that?
 Is that supposed to be funny?
 Look, we think this place ain't safe.
 This place ain't secure anymore.
 We're leavin' and you should go with us.
 Nobody's goin' anywhere.
 Piss on this fuckin' turd.
 - We're outta here.
 - Don't take another step, Mr.
 White.
 Fuck you, maniac!
 It's your fuckin' fault we're in this trouble!
 What's this guy's problem?
 What's my problem?
 Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!
 I got a big fuckin' problem with any trigger-happy madman who almost gets me shot!
 - What the fuck you talkin' about?
 - That fucking shooting spree!
 In the store!
 Remember?
 Oh, fuck 'em.
 They set off the alarm.
 They deserve what they got.
 You almost killed me!
 Asshole!
 If I knew what kind of guy you were, I never would've agreed to work with you.
 Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie or are you gonna bite?
 What was that?
 I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
 Would you repeat it?
 Are you gonna bark all day, little doggie or are you gonna bite?
 You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
 Hey, come on!
 What, are we on a playground here?
 Am I the only professional?
 You're actin' like a bunch of fuckin' niggers!
 Ever work with niggers?
 Always sayin' they're gonna kill each other.
 You said yourself you thought about taking him out.
 - You fuckin' said that?
 - Yeah, I did, okay?
 But that was then.
 Right now, this guy is the only one I completely trust.
 -He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
 -You takin' his side?
 Fuck sides, man!
 What we need here is solidarity!
 Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker up our ass, and I want to know who.
 Fuck.
 Look, I know I'm no piece of shit.
 I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm fuckin' positive you're on the level.
 So let's try and figure out who the bad guy is, all right?
 Wow.
 That was really exciting.
 I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?
 Yeah, me too.
 I love that guy.
 My heart's beatin' so fast, I'm about to have a heart attack here.
 I got somethin' outside that I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.
 Follow you?
 Where?
 To my car.
 Did you forget your French fries to go with the soda?
 No, I had them already.
 I got somethin' I think you might wanna see, though.
 - What?
 - It's a big surprise.
 I'm sure you'll like it.
 Come on.
 We still gotta get outta here, you know.
 No.
 We're gonna stick around and we're gonna wait.
 - What for?
 The cops?
 - No.
 Nice Guy Eddie.
 Nice Guy Eddie?
 What makes you think he isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?
 Because I spoke to him on the phone and he said he's on the way down here.
 You talked to Nice Guy Eddie?
 Why didn't you say that in the first place?
 - 'Cause you never asked me.
 - Hardy-fuckin'-har.
 - What'd he say?
 - He said stay put.
 So in the meantime I'll show you guys somethin'.
 Jesus Christ.
 Maybe our boy in blue here can answer some of these questions about this rat business you've been talkin' about.
 You're a piece of work, my friend.
 Let's get him the fuck outta here.
 Hey, Sid, will you relax?
 I've known you a long time.
 I'm not worried.
 I know you'll pay me back.
 Don't tell me what I already know.
 Don't embarrass me.
 So you had a few bad months.
 You do what everybody else does.
 I don't care if it's J.
P.
 Morgan or lrving the tailor.
 You ride it out.
 - Vic Vega's outside.
 - Hold on.
 - Who?
 - Vic Vega.
 Tell him to come in.
 I gotta go.
 - Come on in.
 - A friend of mine's outside.
 I'll be talkin' to you.
 Don't worry.
 Hey, welcome home, Vic.
 How does freedom feel, huh?
 - It's a change.
 - Ain't that the sad truth.
 Sit down, take your coat off, make yourself at home.
 - Have a little drink?
 - Yeah.
 How about a little Remy Martin?
 Sure.
 Who's your parole officer?
 Seymour Scagnetti.
 How is he?
 He's a fuckin' asshole.
 Won't even let me leave the halfway house.
 It never ceases to amaze me.
 A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there, slits a woman's throat for 25 cents he gets Doris Day for a parole officer.
 A good fella like you winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.
 I want you to know I appreciate all the packages you sent me on the inside.
 What the hell was I supposed to do?
 Forget about you?
 I just want you to know that it meant a lot to me.
 It was the least I could do.
 I wish to hell I could've done a lot more.
 Thanks a lot, Joe.
 Ah, Vic.
 Toothpick Vic.
 So tell me your story, kid.
 What are your plans?
 You son of a bitch.
 I see you sittin' there, but I don't believe it.
 - How you doin', Toothpick?
 - Hey, Eddie.
 Listen, I'm sorry.
 I should've picked you up myself.
 I was-- My fuckin'-- This week's been crazy.
 I've had my head up my ass the whole time.
 Funny you say that, 'cause that's what me and your daddy were talkin' about.
 That I should've picked you up?
 No, that you had your head up your ass.
 I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic I'm so glad somebody's finally here who knows what's goin' on.
 My son Eddie's a fuck-up.
 He's ruining the business.
 I mean, I love the guy, but he's flushin' everything down the toilet.

" That's what you said, right, Joe?
 Tell him yourself.
 Eddie, I hate for you to hear it like this but Vic came in and asked me how business was.
 You don't lie to a guy who's just done four years in the slammer.
 That's very true.
 All right, enough of this shit!
 Break it up!
 Come on, this ain't a playground!
 You guys wanna roll around on the floor, you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.
 - Daddy, did you see that?
 - What?
 The guy got me on the ground, he tried to fuck me.
 - You wish.
 - You sick bastard, Vic.
 You tried to fuck me in my father's office.
 Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do in the privacy of your own home go to it, but don't try to fuck me.
 I don't think of you that way.
 I like you a lot, buddy, but I don't think of you that way.
 Listen, if I was a butt cowboy, I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.
 No, you wouldn't.
 You'd keep me for yourself.
 Four years fuckin' punks up the ass, you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.
 I might break you in, Nice Guy, but I'd make you my dog's bitch.
 Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?
 A man walks into prison a white man, walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.
 You know what?
 I think it's all that black semen pumped up your asshole, now it's backed into your fuckin' brain and it's comin' out your mouth!
 Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch, I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.
 Enough of that shit!
 I'm sick of it!
 Now both of you, sit down.
 Now, Eddie when you came in here, we were talkin' some serious business.
 Vic here's got a parole problem.
 - Who's your P.
O.
?
 - Seymour Scagnetti.
 Scagnetti.
 Fuck.
 - I hear he's a motherfucker.
 - Oh, he's a fucker.
 Won't even let me leave the halfway house unless I get some shitty job.
 You're comin' back to work for us, right?
 Well, I wanna.
 But first I gotta prove to, uh, ass-head that I can get a regular, you know, job-type job before I can move out on my own.
 I can't come back to work for you guys if I gotta worry about, uh makin' some silly-ass 10:00 curfew every fuckin' night.
 We can work this out, can't we, Eddie?
 This ain't all that bad.
 We can get you a lot of legitimate jobs.
 I'll get you down in Long Beach as a dockworker.
 I don't wanna lift no fuckin' crates, Eddie.
 You ain't gonna lift shit.
 You don't even work there.
 But as far as the records are concerned, you do.
 I call Matthews and tell him he's got a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.
 You get a time card.
 It's clocked in and out for you every day.
 At the end of the week you get a nice paycheck.
 Dockworkers do very well.
 You can move into a halfway decent place without Scagnetti goin'
"Where the fuck's the money comin' from?

" And, if he decides to make a surprise visit that's the day we sent you to Tustin to pick up a load of shit.
 If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.
 You just missed him.
 We had to send him to the Taft airstrip five fuckin' hours away.
 We had a load of shit he had to pick up there and bring back here.

" Part of your job is goin' different places.
 That's the beauty of it.
 We got places all over the place.
 See, Vic?
 Did I tell you not to worry?
 - Vic was worried.
 - I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.
 We'll get you fixed up with Matthews, I'll tell him what's what.
 You know, I really appreciate what you guys are doin' but I'd like to know when I can come back you know, do some real work.
 Well, it's hard to say.
 It's kind of a strange time now.
 Things are kind of-- They're a little fucked up, is what they are.
 We're just gettin' ready for a big meetin' right now in Vegas.
 Look, just let Eddie for now set you up at Long Beach.
 Get you a job, give you some cash and get this Scagnetti fuck off your back and then we'll talk to you, all right?
 Huh?
 Dad, I got an idea.
 Just hear me out.
 I know you don't like usin' the boys on these jobs but Vic here-- I mean, he's only been nothin' but good luck for us.
 The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot, for cryin' out loud.
 I'd like to have him in.
 You know he can handle himself, and you damn sure know you can trust him.
 All right, Vic how would you feel about pullin' a job with about five other guys?
 I'd feel great about it.
 K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s
" continues.
 If you're the 12th caller you'll win two tickets to the monster truck extravaganza being held tonight at the Carson Fairgrounds featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth.

" The 12th caller wins on the station where the '70s survived.
 Hey, Dov, we got a major situation here.
 I know you know that.
 I gotta talk to Daddy and find out what he wants done.
 All I know is what Vic told me.
 The place turned into a bullet-fest.
 He took a cop hostage just to get the fuck outta there.
 Get up!
 Get up!
 Do I sound like I'm fuckin' jokin'?
 He's fuckin' drivin' around with a cop in his trunk!
 I don't know who did what!
 I don't know who's got the loot.
 I don't know if anybody's got the loot.
 I don't know who's dead, who's alive, who's caught, who's not.
 I will know.
 I'm practically there now.
 But what do I tell these guys about Daddy?
 All right.
 You sure that's what he said?
 Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.
 Huh?
 Fuck you!
 You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
 You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
 You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
 You're gonna suffer for nothin', pal.
 You hear me?
 'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.
 - I don't fucking know anything!
 - You fuckin' know.
 You know.
 Look at me.
 You fuckin' know.
 What in the Sam Hill's goin' on here?
 - Nice Guy, we got a cop.
 - Where the fuck is Joe?
 Holy shit.
 Orange is dead.
 No, he's not dead, but he will be if we don't get him taken care of.
 We were set up.
 The cops were there waitin' for us.
 What?
 Nobody fuckin' set anybody up.
 The cops were there waitin' for us.
 - Bullshit.
 - Fuck you, man!
 You weren't there, we were, and the cops had that store staked out.
 Okay, Mr.
 Fuckin' Detective, you're so fuckin' smart.
 - Who did it?
 - We've been askin' each other!
 What'd you come up with?
 You think I fuckin' set you up?
 I don't know, but somebody did.
 Nobody did.
 You fuckin' assholes turned the jewelry store-- - Don't you call me an asshole!
 - You fuckin' idiot!
 Turned the jewelry store into a wild west show and you wonder why the fuckin' cops show up?
 Where's Joseph?
 I don't know.
 I ain't talked to him.
 I talked to Dov.
 He says Daddy's comin' down here and he's fuckin' pissed.
 He's pissed?
 I told you he'd be pissed.
 What'd Joe say?
 I told you, I ain't talked to him!
 - All I know is he's pissed.
 - What are you gonna do about him?
 Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
 I got a few questions of my own here.
 You ain't dying.
 He is.
 All right, Mr.
 Fuckin' Compassion, I will call somebody!
 Who?
 A fuckin' snake charmer!
 Who do you think?
 I'll call a doctor.
 They'll fix him right up.
 What happened to Brown and Blue?
 Brown's dead.
 We don't know what happened to Blue.
 Brown's dead?
 Are you sure?
 I'm sure.
 I was there.
 He took one in the head.
 Nobody's got a clue what happened to Mr.
 Blue?
 Either he's alive or he's dead or the cops got him or they don't.
 I take it this is the bastard you told me about.
 Why are you beatin' on him?
 Maybe he could tell us who set us up.
 You beat this prick long enough, he'll tell you he started the Chicago Fire.
 Now that don't necessarily make it fuckin' so!
 Come on, man, think!
 All right, first things fuckin' last.
 Who's got the stones?
 Please, somebody tell me one little fuckin' favor.
 I got a bag.
 Okay?
 I stashed it 'til we could be sure this place wasn't a police station.
 Good for you.
 Now let's go get it.
 First we gotta get rid of those cars.
 It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.
 Okay.
 Blondie, stay here and baby-sit them two.
 White and Pink, take a car each.
 I'll follow you.
 You ditch 'em.
 Pick up the stones.
 While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange some sort of a doctor for our friend.
 You can't leave these guys here with him.
 - Why not?
 - Because he's a fuckin' psycho.
 And if you think Joe's pissed off that ain't nothin' compared to how pissed off I am at him for puttin' me in the same room as that bastard.
 You see what I've been puttin' up with, Eddie?
 I fuckin' walked in here, I told these guys about stayin' put.
 Mr.
 White whips out his gun, he's stickin' it in my face callin' me a motherfucker, sayin' he's gonna blow me away and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
 He's the reason the joint turned into a shootin' spree.
 What are you, a fuckin' silent partner?
 Tell him!
 He went crazy in the store, but he seems all right now.
 This is what he was doin': bam, bam bam, bam.
 Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
 I told 'em not to touch the fuckin' alarm, they did.
 If they hadn't have done what I told 'em not to do, they'd still be alive.
 My fuckin' hero.
 Thanks.
 That's your excuse for going on a kill-crazy rampage?
 I don't like alarms, Mr.
 White.
 What does it matter who stays with the cop?
 We ain't lettin' him go.
 He's seen everybody.
 I haven't been looking at you guys.
 Shut the fuck up, man!
 You guys should never have taken him outta the trunk in the first place.
 - We tried to find out about the setup.
 - There is no fuckin' setup!
 Now here's the news!
 Blondie, you stay here, take care of these two!
 White and Pink, you come with me, 'cause if Joe gets here and he sees all these cars parked outside I swear to you he's gonna be just as mad at me as he is at you.
 Fine.
 Let's go.
 Alone at last.
 Guess what.
 I think I'm parked in the red zone.
 Now, where were we?
 I told you, I don't know anything about any fuckin' setup.
 I've been on the force for only eight months.
 They don't tell me anything.
 Nobody tells me shit.
 You can torture me all you want.
 Torture you?
 That's a good-- That's a good idea.
 I like that one, yeah.
 Even your boss said there wasn't a setup.
 - My what?
 - Your boss.
 Excuse me, pal.
 One thing I wanna make clear to you: I don't have a boss.
 Nobody tells me what to do.
 You understand?
 You hear what I said, you son of a bitch?
 All right, all right, all right, you don't have a boss.
 Get that fuckin' shit off.
 Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you, okay?
 I don't really give a good fuck what you know or don't know but I'm gonna torture you anyway regardless.
 Not to get information.
 It's amusing to me to torture a cop.
 You can say anything you want because I've heard it all before.
 All you can do is pray for a quick death which you ain't gonna get.
 Oh, God.
 You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s
"?
 It's my personal favorite.
 Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel when they recorded this Dylanesque, pop, bubble-gum favorite from April of 1974.
 That reached up to number five as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s
" continues.
 Hold still.
 Hold still, you fuck.
 Was that good for you too?
 Hey, what's goin' on?
 You hear that?
 Don't go anywhere.
 I'll be right back.
 Don't!
 Stop!
 Stop!
 - What?
 What's the matter?
 - Don't do this.
 That burn a little bit?
 Don't!
 Stop!
 Please stop.
 Just stop.
 Stop.
 Just talk to me.
 Don't.
 Please.
 Don't burn me, please.
 I don't know anything about any of you fucking guys.
 I'm not gonna say anything.
 No!
 Please, no.
 - You all through?
 - Stop!
 You all through?
 Please.
 I got a little kid at home.
 You all done?
 - Don't!
 - Have some fire.
 Oh, shit.
 Hey, you.
 What's your name?
 Marvin.
 Marvin what?
 Marvin Nash.
 Listen to me, Marvin.
 I'm a-- Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
 I'm a cop.
 Yeah, I know.
 You do?
 Yeah.
 Your name's Freddy somethin'.
 Newendyke.
 Freddy Newendyke.
 Frankie Ferchetti introduced us about five months ago.
 I don't remember that at all.
 I do.
 Freddy.
 How do I look?
 What?
 I don't know what to tell you, Marvin.
 That fuck.
 That sick fuck!
 That fuckin' bastard!
 Marvin, I need you to hold on.
 There's cops waiting to move a block away.
 What the fuck are they waiting for?
 This fuckin' guy, he slashes my face and cuts my fuckin' ear off!
 I'm fuckin' deformed!
 Fuck you!
 I'm fuckin' dyin' here!
 I'm fuckin' dyin'!
 They're not to make a move 'til Joe Cabot shows up.
 I was sent in to get him.
 All right?
 You heard 'em.
 They said he's on his way.
 Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin.
 We're just gonna sit here and bleed 'til Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
 Say hello to a motherfucker who's inside.
 Cabot's doing a job.
 He wants me on the team.
 This better not be a joke.
 This ain't a joke.
 I'm in.
 I'm up his ass.
 Nice Guy Eddie tells me Joe wants to meet me.
 He says I should just wait for a phone call.
 After waiting three days he calls me last night and says Joe's ready.
 - He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
 - Who picked you up?
 - Nice Guy.
 We get to a bar.
 - What bar?
 Smokey Pete's in Gardena.
 We get there and I meet Joe and a guy named Mr.
 White.
 Phony name.
 My name's Mr.
 Orange.
 - Mr.
 Orange?
 - Mr.
 Orange.
 Okay, Mr.
 Orange.
 - You ever see this motherfucker before?
 - Who?
 Mr.
 White?
 Yes.
 Mr.
 White.
 No.
 He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
 He's gotta be from out of town.
 - Joe knows him good.
 - How can you tell?
 The way they talk.
 You can tell they're buddies.
 - You two talk?
 - Me and Joe?
 Mr.
 White.
 - A little.
 - About what?
 The Brewers.
 Milwaukee Brewers?
 They won the night before.
 He made some money off them.
 Good.
 If this crook's a Brewers fan, he's gotta be from Wisconsin.
 And I'll bet you everything they got a sheet in Milwaukee on this Mr.
 White's ass.
 So I want you to go through everybody in Milwaukee with a history of armed robbery and put a name to the face.
 - Nice work, Freddy.
 - Thank you, my man.
 - How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
 - Perfect.
 His backing me up went a long way.
 I told them I played poker with him.
 Nice Guy checked it out and said it was A-okay.
 Said I was a good thief, I didn't rattle and that I was ready to move.
 He's a good guy.
 I wouldn't be inside without him.
 Long Beach Mike is not your friend.
 Long Beach Mike is a fucking scumbag.
 He's selling out his friends.
 That's how nice he fuckin' is.
 I'll take care of his ass but you get that scumbag out of mind and take care of business.
 Gone.
 Use the commode story?
 - What's the commode story?
 - It's a scene.
 Memorize it.
 - A what?
 - Undercover cops gotta be Brando.
 To do this job you gotta be a great actor, naturalistic.
 You gotta be naturalistic as hell.
 If you're a bad actor, that's bullshit in this job.
 What is this?
 That's an amusing anecdote about a drug deal.
 Something funny that happened to you while you were doing a job.
 I gotta memorize all this?
 There's four pages of this shit.
 Think about it like it's a joke.
 Memorize what's important.
 The rest you make your own.
 You can tell a joke, can't you?
 Well, pretend you're Don Rickles and tell a joke, all right?
 The things you gotta remember are the details.
 The details sell your story.
 This particular story takes place in a men's room.
 You gotta know all the details-- whether they got paper towels or a blower to dry your hands.
 You gotta know if the stalls ain't got no doors or not.
 You gotta know if they got liquid soap or that pink, granulated shit they used in high school.
 You gotta know if they got hot water or not, if it stinks if some nasty, lowlife, scum-ridden motherfucker sprayed diarrhea all over one of the bowls.
 You gotta know every detail there is to know about this commode.
 What you gotta do is take all them details and make 'em your own.
 While you're doing that, remember that this story is about you and how you perceived the events that went down.
 The only way to do that is keep sayin' it and sayin' it and sayin' it.
 This is during the L.
A.
 marijuana drought, 1986.
 I still had a connection, which was insane 'cause you couldn't get any weed anywhere then.
 Anyway, I had a connection with this hippie chick in Santa Cruz and all my friends knew it.
 They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--
" I say,
"Hey, dude.
 You gettin' some?
 Can you get some for me too?

" They knew I still smoked, so they asked me to buy some for them.
 It got to be-- Every time I bought some weed I was buyin' for four or five people.
 Finally I said, fuck this shit.
 I'm makin' this bitch rich.
 She didn't even have to meet these people.
 I was doing all the work.
 That got to be a pain in the ass, people calling all the time.
 I couldn't even rent a tape without six fuckin' interruptions.

"When's the next time you're gettin' some?

"
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin' to watch The Lost Boys.
 When I get some, I'll call you.

" Then these rink-a-dink potheads come by.
 They're my friends and everything, but still-- I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags, they don't want 60 dollars worth.
 They want ten dollars' worth, and breaking it up wasn't easy.
 I don't even know what ten dollars' worth looks like.
 This was a very weird situation.
 Remember back in '86 there was a major fuckin' drought.
 Nobody had anything.
 People were livin' on resin, smokin' the wood in their pipes.
 This chick had a bunch and she's beggin' me to sell it.
 So I told her I wasn't gonna be Joe the pot man anymore but I would take a little bit and sell it to my close friends.
 She agreed and we kept the same arrangement as before-- ten percent and free pot for me if I helped her that weekend.
 She was sellin' a brick of weed and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.
 Her brother usually goes with her, but he's in County unexpectedly.
 What for?
 His traffic tickets gone to warrant.
 They stopped him, found warrants on him, took him to County.
 She doesn't wanna walk around alone with all that weed.
 I don't wanna do this.
 I have a very bad feeling about it.
 She keeps asking me, asking me.
 Finally I said okay 'cause I'm sick of hearing it.
 - So we go to the train station-- - Wait.
 You're goin' to the train station with the weed on ya?
 The guy needed it right away.
 Anyway, we get to the train station and we're waitin' for the guy.
 I'm carryin' the weed in a carry-on bag.
 I gotta take a piss, so I tell her I'm goin' to the boy's room.
 So I walk into the men's room and who's standing there?
 Four Los Angeles County sheriffs and a German shepherd.
 - They're waitin' for you?
 - No, they're just talkin'.
 When I walked in, they all stopped talkin' and they looked at me.
 That's hard.
 That's a fuckin' hard situation.
 German shepherd starts barking.
 He's barkin' at me.
 I mean, it's obvious he's barkin' at me.
 Every nerve ending, all of my senses, the blood in the veins was screamin':
"Take off, man.
 Just bail.
 Get the fuck outta there.

" Panic hits me like a bucket of water.
 Bam!
 Right in the face.
 I'm drenched in panic and these cops are lookin' at me and they know it.
 They can smell it, sure as that fuckin' dog can.
 They can smell it on me.
 Shut up.
 So anyway, I got my gun drawn.
 I point it at this guy and I tell him
"Freeze.
 Don't fuckin' move.

" This little idiot's looking right at me and saying
"I know, I know.

" But meanwhile his right hand is creepin' toward the glove box.
 I scream at him,
"Asshole!
 I'm gonna blow you away right now!
 Put your hands on the dash.

" He's still looking at me, nodding his head.

"I know, buddy, I know.

" Meanwhile his hand is still going for the glove box.
 And I said
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you in the face if you don't put your hands up.

" Then this guy's girlfriend, this real sexy Oriental bitch she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?
 Listen to the officer!
 Put your hands on the dash!

" So then the guy snaps out of it and puts his hands on the dash.
 What was he goin' for?
 His fucking registration.
 - You're kidding.
 - No, man!
 Stupid citizen doesn't know how close he came to gettin' blown away.
 That close, man.
 You knew how to handle that situation.
 You shit your pants, dive in and swim.
 Tell me more about Cabot.
 I don't know.
 He's a cool guy.
 He's funny.
 He's a funny guy.
 You remember the Fantastic Four?
 Yeah, with that invisible bitch and
"Flame on
" and shit, right?
 Thing.
 Motherfucker Iooks just like the Thing.
 Hey!
 Showtime!
 Grab your jacket.
 I'm parked outside.
 I'll be right down.
 He'll be right down.
 Don't pussy out on me now.
 They don't know.
 They don't know shit.
 You're not gonna get hurt.
 You're fuckin' Baretta.
 They believe every fuckin' word 'cause you're super cool.
 There goes our boy.
 The guy has to have rocks in his head the size of Gibraltar to work undercover.
 - You want one of these?
 - Yeah, give me the bear claw.
 I know what I'm talking about.
 Black women ain't the same as white women.
 There's a slight difference.
 Very funny.
 You know what I mean.
 What a white bitch will put up with, a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.
 If you cross their line, they fuck you up.
 I gotta go along with Pink on that.
 Okay, Mr.
 Expert, if this is such a truism why is it that every nigger I know treats his woman like a piece of shit?
 I'll bet those same niggers who show their ass in public when their bitches get 'em home they chill the fuck out.
 - Not these guys.
 - Oh, yeah.
 Those guys too.
 Tell you guys a story.
 In one of Daddy's clubs there's a black cocktail waitress named Elois.
 - Elois?
 - Yeah, Elois.
 E and Lois.
 We called her Lady E.
 Where was she from?
 Compton?
 She's from Ladora Heights.
 Ladora Heights.
 The black Beverly Hills.
 It's not the black Beverly Hills.
 It's the black Palos Verdes.
 Anyway Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
 Un-fuckin'-believable.
 Every guy who ever saw her had to jack off to her at least once.
 You know who she looked like?
 Christie Love.
 Remember that TV show Get Christie Love about the black female cop?
 She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar!

" - Who played Christie Love?
 - Pam Grier.
 No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
 Pam Grier was the other one.
 Pam Grier did the film.
 Christie Love was like a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.
 - So, who was Christie Love?
 - How should I know?
 Great.
 Now I'm totally fuckin' tortured.
 Whoever it was, she looked exactly like Elois.
 Anne Francis.
 No.
 That was Honey West.
 Anne Francis is white.
 I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
 She looked exactly like Elois.
 We come into the club one night and there's Carlos, the bartender.
 He's a wetback.
 He's a friend of mine.
 I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?

" Apparently Lady E was married to real piece of dog shit, a real animal.
 He used to do things to her.
 Like what?
 What would he do?
 Beat her up?
 I don't know.
 He just did things.
 So anyway, one night she plays it real cool.
 She waits for him to get drunk.
 He falls asleep on the fuckin' couch.
 She sneaks up on him, puts some glue on his dick and glues his dick to his belly.
 Jesus Christ!
 I'm serious, man.
 I'm dead serious.
 They had to call the paramedics to cut the prick loose.
 Was he all pissed off?
 How would you feel if you had to do a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?
 You guys like to tell jokes and giggle and kid around, huh?
 Giggling like a bunch of girls in the schoolyard.
 Well, let me tell a joke.
 Five guys sittin' in a bullpen San Quentin wonderin' how the fuck they got there.

"What did we do wrong?
 What shouldn't we have done?
 It's your fault, his fault--
" All that bullshit.
 Finally somebody says
"Wait a minute.
 While we were planning this caper we just sat around tellin' fuckin' jokes.

" Got the message?
 I don't mean to holler at ya.
 When this caper's over, and I'm sure it'll be successful we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands, I'll laugh with all of youse.
 Find me a different character down there.
 Right now it's a matter of business.
 With the exception of Eddie and myself who you already know we're gonna be using aliases on this job.
 Under no circumstances do we want any one of you to relate to each other by your Christian names.
 And I don't want any talk about yourself personally.
 That includes where you been, your wife's name where you might've done time or a bank maybe you robbed in St.
 Petersburg.
 All I want you guys to talk about, if you have to is what you're gonna do.
 That should do it.
 These are your names-- Mr.
 Brown, Mr.
 White Mr.
 Blonde, Mr.
 Blue Mr.
 Orange and Mr.
 Pink.
 - Why am I Mr.
 Pink?
 - Because you're a faggot!
 All right?
 - Why can't we pick our own colors?
 - No way.
 No way.
 Tried it once.
 It doesn't work.
 You get four guys all fightin' over who gets to be Mr.
 Black.
 They don't know each other, so nobody wants to back down.
 No way.
 I pick.
 You're Mr.
 Pink.
 Be thankful you're not Mr.
 Yellow.
 But Mr.
 Brown, that's too close to Mr.
 Shit.
 Mr.
 Pink sounds like Mr.
 Pussy.
 How about Mr.
 Purple?
 That's sounds good.
 I'll be Mr.
 Purple.
 You're not Mr.
 Purple.
 Some guy on some other job is Mr.
 Purple.
 You're Mr.
 Pink!
 Who cares what your name is?
 Easy for you to say.
 You're Mr.
 White.
 You have a cool-sounding name.
 If it's no big deal to be Mr.
 Pink, you wanna trade?
 Nobody's tradin' with anybody.
 This ain't a goddamn fuckin' city council meeting, you know.
 Now listen up, Mr.
 Pink.
 There's two ways you can go on this job-- my way or the highway.
 What's it gonna be, Mr.
 Pink?
 Jesus Christ, Joe.
 Fuckin' forget about it.
 It's beneath me.
 I'm Mr.
 Pink.
 Let's move on.
 I'll move on when I feel like it.
 Do all you guys got the goddamn message?
 I'm so goddamn mad hollerin' at you guys, I can hardly talk.
 Let's go to work.
 Let's go over it.
 Where are you?
 I stand outside and guard the door.
 I don't let anybody go in or out.
 - Mr.
 Brown.
 - He waits in the car.
 I give him the signal, he pulls up in front.
 Mr.
 Blonde and Mr.
 Blue.
 Crowd control.
 They handle the customers and the employees.
 - That girl's ass.
 - Sittin' right here on my dick.
 Myself and Mr.
 Pink?
 You two take the manager and make him give you the diamonds.
 We're there for those stones, period.
 Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off.
 We're out in two minutes, not one second longer.
 What if the manager won't give you the diamonds?
 A store like this is insured up the ass.
 They're not supposed to give you any resistance whatsoever.
 If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson smash their nose with your gun.
 Drops him right to the floor.
 Everyone jumps.
 He falls down screaming, blood squirts out of his nose.
 Freaks everybody out.
 Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.
 Some bitch might talk shit to you.
 Give her a look like she's next.
 Watch her shut the fuck up.
 If it's the manager, that's different.
 The managers know not to fuck around so if he's giving you static he probably thinks he's a real cowboy so you gotta that bastard in two.
 If he won't tell ya something, cut off one of his fingers.
 The little one.
 Then tell him his thumb's next.
 After that he'll tell you if he wears ladies underwear.
 I'm hungry.
 Let's get a taco.
 Fuck.
 Jesus.
 I'm blind, man.
 I'm fuckin' blind.
 No, you just got blood in your eyes.
 Is he dead?
 Did he die or not?
 Let's go.
 Hold it!
 Get out!
 Get out of the fuckin' car!
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry, Larry.
 I can't believe she killed me.
 Who'd have fucking thought that?
 Hey, just cancel that shit right now.
 You're hurt.
 You're hurt real fuckin' bad.
 But you ain't dying.
 All this blood's scaring the shit out of me, Larry.
 I'm gonna die.
 I know it.
 What the fuck happened?
 He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
 What?
 I didn't hear you.
 I said Blonde went crazy.
 He slashed the cop's face, cut off his ear and was gonna burn him alive.
 This cop?
 He went crazy?
 Something like that?
 Worse or better?
 Eddie, he was pulling a burn, man.
 He was gonna kill the cop and me.
 When you guys walked in, he was gonna kill you and run with the diamonds.
 What'd I tell ya?
 That sick piece of shit was a stone-cold psycho.
 You should've asked the cop, not just killed him.
 He talked about what he was gonna do when he was slicing him up.
 I don't buy it.
 Doesn't make sense.
 Makes perfect fuckin' sense to me.
 You didn't see how he acted during the job.
 We did.
 He's right.
 The ear's hacked off.
 Let me just say this out loud, 'cause I wanna get this straight.
 You're saying that Mr.
 Blonde was gonna kill you and then when we got back he was gonna kill us take the diamonds and scram.
 I'm right about that, right?
 That's your story?
 I swear on my mother's soul that's what happened.
 The man you killed just got released from prison.
 He got caught at a company warehouse full of hot items.
 He could've fuckin' walked.
 All he had to do was say my dad's name, but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.
 He did his fuckin' time like a man.
 He did four years for us.
 So, Mr.
 Orange you're telling me that this good friend of mine who did four years for my father who, in four years, never made a deal, no matter what they offered him you're telling me that now that he's free and we're making good on our commitment to him he's just gonna decide, out of the fucking blue to rip us off?
 Why don't you tell me what really happened.
 What the hell for?
 It'd just be more bullshit.
 This man set us up.
 Dad, I'm sorry, but I don't know what's happening.
 - It's all right.
 I do.
 - What are you talking about?
 That lump of shit's workin' with the L.
A.
P.
D.
 I don't have the slightest fucking idea what you're talking about.
 Joe, I don't know what you think you know, but you're wrong.
 Like hell I am.
 Trust me on this.
 You've made a mistake.
 He's a good kid.
 I understand you're super-fuckin'-pissed.
 We're all real emotional.
 But you're barking up the wrong tree.
 I know him.
 He wouldn't do that.
 You don't know jack shit!
 I do.
 The cocksucker tipped off the cops and got Mr.
 Brown and Mr.
 Blue killed.
 - Mr.
 Blue is dead?
 - Dead as Dillinger.
 How do you know all this?
 He was the only one I wasn't 100 percent on.
 I should have my head examined, going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.
 - That's your proof?
 - With instinct, you don't need proof.
 I ignored it before, but no more.
 Have you lost your fuckin' mind?
 I'm not gonna let you make a terrible mistake.
 Come on, guys.
 Nobody wants this.
 We're supposed to be fuckin' professionals.
 Larry, look it's been quite a long time.
 A lot of jobs.
 There's no need for this, man.
 Let's just put our guns down and let's settle this with a fucking conversation.
 Joe, if you kill that man, you die next.
 Repeat: you kill him, you die next.
 Larry, we have been friends.
 You respect my dad and I respect you but I'll put bullets in you.
 You put that fuckin' gun down now.
 Goddamn you, Joe don't make me do this.
 Larry, you stop pointin' that gun at my dad!
 I'm sorry, kid.
 Looks like we're gonna do a little time.
 I'm a cop.
 Larry I'm sorry.
 I'm so sorry.
 I'm a cop.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorry.
 I'm sorr-- Freeze!
 Drop the fucking gun, buddy!
 - Now!
 - Put the gun down!
 - Don't do it!
 - Drop the gun, man!
 - Drop the fucking gun!
 - We're gonna blow you away!
